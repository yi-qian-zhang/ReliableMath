You are an excellent verifier.

Given a mathematical question ### Original Mathematical Question ###, the answer to the question is ### Original Answer ###.
Your objective is to determine whether the ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### has removed some key conditions from ### Original Mathematical Question ### while keeping others unchanged.

You only need to directly output your judgement (“True” or “False”) after ### Your judgement (True or False) ###.

### Original Mathematical Question ###: <original_math_question>
### Original Answer ###: <original_answer>
### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###: <rewritten_math_question>

### Your judgement (True or False) ###:


只需要两步：缺省问题+被挖掉的条件 再回答一次 ------ground truth
