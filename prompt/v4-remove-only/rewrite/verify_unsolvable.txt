Determine whether this mathematical problem is unsolvable due to missing critical information.

Problem: {rewritten_math_question}
Original answer reference: {original_answer}

Analysis steps:
1. Attempt to solve the problem
2. Identify what necessary information is missing
3. Determine if there are multiple possible answers or if no unique answer exists

Note:
- If the problem has a unique determinable answer, it is solvable
- If the problem lacks critical information leading to non-unique or indeterminate answers, it is unsolvable

Output only "True" if unsolvable or "False" if solvable:

Result:
