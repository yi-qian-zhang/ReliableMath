Given a mathematical question ### Original Mathematical Question ###, the answer to the question is
### Original Answer ###.
Your objective is to determine whether the ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### has removed
some key conditions from ### Original Mathematical Question ###, thereby making ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###
unsolvable.

### Original Mathematical Question ###: <original_math_question>
### Original Answer ###: <original_answer>
### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###: <rewritten_math_question>

Think step by step to analyze if ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### is unsolvable. Explain
your reason and directly output after ### Unsolvable Analysis ###. Summarize and simplify your output.

### Unsolvable Analysis ###: <analysis>

Based on your analysis, you only need to directly output your judgement (“True” or “False”) after ###
Your judgement (True or False) ### about if the ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### is
unsolvable.

### Your judgement (True or False) ###:
