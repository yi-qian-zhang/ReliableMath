You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem quality.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem is a VALID Missing Information Problem (MIP).

### Core Understanding of MIP

A Valid MIP must be UNSOLVABLE (Undeterminable).
* The Logic: The problem logic breaks because a necessary link is missing. The model should fail to answer or state "insufficient information."
* The Goal: We want to test if the model can detect dependency (e.g., "I cannot find Y because I don't know X").

An Invalid MIP is OPEN-ENDED (Infinite/Arbitrary Solutions).
* The Error: The problem loses its strict constraints (like "maximum", "unique", "integer"), allowing the model to validly output ANY random number that fits the loose description. This is NOT a valid MIP.

---

### Verification Criteria

Check if the rewritten problem has any of these THREE CRITICAL ISSUES.

Issue 1: Unintended Infinite Solutions (Open-Endedness)

The original problem asks for a UNIQUE, SPECIFIC answer, but the rewritten problem removes the specific constraints, allowing infinitely many valid answers without changing the nature of the question.

* Common Invalid Cases:
  1. Removed uniqueness specifiers:
     - Original: "Find THE LARGEST prime divisor"
     - Invalid Rewrite: "Find a prime divisor" (Now any prime divisor works -> Infinite/Many choices)
     
  2. Removed domain constraints that prevent infinite solutions:
     - Original: "tan(53)tan(81)tan(x) = ... where 0 < x < 180"
     - Invalid Rewrite: Removed "0 < x < 180" (Now x = 7, 187, 367... all work due to periodicity)
     
  3. Removed degree/type specifications:
     - Original: "Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3"
     - Invalid Rewrite: "Let P(x) be a polynomial" (Now degree 1, 2, 4... all work)

* Valid MIP Examples (NOT Issue 1):
  - Original: "x = 2, xy = 10, find y" -> Rewrite: "xy = 10, find y"
    (VALID! This is unsolvable logic, distinct from simply removing a "largest" constraint.)
  - Original: "Circle with center (0,0) and radius 5" -> Rewrite: "Circle with center (0,0)"
    (VALID! We cannot determine the exact circle.)

Detection Rule:
1. Does the original ask for "The value", "The maximum", "The unique x"?
2. Does the rewrite lose the condition that locks this answer?
3. Can I now provide ANY random number and claim it's a valid answer? (If YES -> INVALID)

Issue 2: Mathematical Errors or Value Changes

The rewriting process must NEVER change numbers, flip signs, or create illegal operations.

* Critical Rules:
  1. Numbers must NEVER be changed: 0.25 cannot become -0.25.
  2. Signs must NEVER be flipped: log(x) cannot become log(-x).
  3. No illegal operations should be introduced.

* Examples of Errors:
  - Changed "log(0.25)" to "log(-0.25)" (Number sign flipped)
  - Changed "x > 0" to "x < 0" where problem contains sqrt(x) (Makes operation illegal)
  - Changed "sin(30)" to "sin(-30)" (Sign flipped)

Issue 3: Context, Examples, or Assumptions Deleted

The original problem contains illustrative examples or explicit assumptions (using phrases like "For example", "Assume"), but the rewritten problem removed them. These are CONTEXT, not conditions.

* Example A (Example deleted):
  - Original: "On a keyboard, the key for digit 1 is broken. For example, typing 123 prints 23. Sasha types..."
  - Invalid Rewrite: "On a keyboard, a key is broken. Sasha types..."
  - Why Invalid: The example "123 -> 23" defines WHICH key is broken. Without it, the problem is ambiguous.

* Example B (Assumption deleted):
  - Original: "A firecracker explodes... Find the speed. Assume g = 10 m/s^2."
  - Invalid Rewrite: "A firecracker explodes... Find the speed."
  - Why Invalid: The assumption "g = 10" is a fixed parameter, not a removable condition.

Trigger Phrases to Watch:
- "For example", "For instance", "e.g.", "such as"
- "Assume", "Suppose", "Let's say"

### Analysis Instructions

Step 1: Check Issue 1 (Open-Endedness)
- Did the rewrite remove words like "largest", "smallest", "integer", "unique"?
- Does it create infinite arbitrary answers (Invalid) OR become logically unsolvable (Valid)?

Step 2: Check Issue 2 (Math Errors)
- Check if ANY numbers or signs differ from the original.

Step 3: Check Issue 3 (Context Loss)
- Check if "For example", "Assume", "Note that" sections are preserved.
