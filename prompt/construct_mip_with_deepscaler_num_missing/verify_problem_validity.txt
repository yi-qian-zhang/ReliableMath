You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem quality.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem is still a VALID mathematical question that is unsolvable (not solvable with infinite solutions).

### Original Problem ###
{original_question}

### Rewritten Problem ###
{rewritten_question}

### Removed Conditions ###
{removed_conditions}

### Verification Criteria ###

Check if the rewritten problem has any of these ISSUES:

**Issue 1: Question Stem Deleted**
- The core question itself was removed (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Determine...")
- The rewritten text is no longer asking a mathematical question
- Example BAD: "A triangle ABC" (not a question!)
- Example GOOD: "A triangle ABC. Find the area." (still a question)

**Issue 2: Dangling References (NEW - CRITICAL)**
- The rewritten problem contains pronouns or references without clear antecedents
- Examples: "this condition", "this value", "it", "these numbers", "the above"
- If removed conditions were referenced by such terms, those terms now point to nothing
- Example BAD: "Only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers satisfy this condition?"
  - "this condition" refers to removed information!
- Example GOOD: "Only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers, when certain digits are removed, result in 202020?"
  - Self-contained, no dangling references

**Issue 3: Missing Essential Context**
- The rewritten problem lacks essential background/scenario needed to understand the question
- Example BAD: "202020 was printed. How many numbers satisfy this?"
  - What's the context? Keyboard? Printer? Mathematical operation?
- Example GOOD: Even with missing conditions, the core scenario should be understandable

**Issue 4: Infinite Solutions (Not Unsolvable)**
- After removing conditions, the problem has infinitely many valid answers
- This is DIFFERENT from unsolvable (where we can't determine a specific answer)
- Example: "Find a number x" (infinite solutions: any number works)
- We want: UNSOLVABLE (missing info to solve)
- We DON'T want: INFINITE SOLUTIONS (too many valid answers)

**Issue 5: Trivially Solvable**
- The problem became too easy and can be solved without the removed conditions
- Example: Removed a red herring that wasn't actually needed

### Analysis Instructions ###

Think step by step:
1. Can someone who ONLY sees the rewritten problem (without the original) understand what is being asked?
2. Are there any pronouns (this, that, it, these) that refer to removed information?
3. Is the core scenario/context still clear?
4. After removing the conditions, is the problem unsolvable OR does it have infinite solutions?
5. Can the problem still be answered without the removed conditions?

### Output Format ###

First, provide your analysis after ### Analysis ###.

### Analysis ###
[Analyze whether the rewritten problem has any of the issues above. Pay special attention to Issues 2 and 3.]

Then, output your judgement after ### Judgement ###.

### Judgement ###
Valid or Invalid

(Output "Valid" ONLY if the rewritten problem is:
 - Self-contained and understandable without the original
 - Has no dangling references
 - Is a proper unsolvable question)
(Output "Invalid" if it has Issue 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
