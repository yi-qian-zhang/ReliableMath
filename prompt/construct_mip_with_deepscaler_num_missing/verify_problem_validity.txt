You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem quality.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem is a VALID Missing Information Problem (MIP).

### Core Understanding of MIP

A Valid MIP must be UNSOLVABLE.
* The Logic: The problem logic breaks because a necessary link is missing. The model should fail to answer or state "insufficient information."
* The Goal: We want to test if the model can detect dependency (e.g., "I cannot find Y because I don't know X").

An Invalid MIP is OPEN-ENDED (Infinite/Arbitrary Solutions).
* The Error: The problem loses its strict constraints (like "maximum", "unique", "integer"), allowing the model to validly output ANY random number that fits the loose description. This is NOT a valid MIP.

---

### Verification Criteria

Check if the rewritten problem has any of these THREE CRITICAL ISSUES.

Issue 1: Unintended Infinite Solutions (Open-Endedness)

The original problem asks for a UNIQUE, SPECIFIC answer, but the rewritten problem removes the specific constraints .

* Common Invalid Cases:
  1. Removed uniqueness specifiers:
     - Original: "Find THE LARGEST prime divisor"
     - Invalid Rewrite: "Find a prime divisor" (Now any prime divisor works -> Infinite/Many choices)
     
  2. Removed domain constraints that prevent infinite solutions:
     - Original: "tan(53)tan(81)tan(x) = ... where 0 < x < 180"
     - Invalid Rewrite: Removed "0 < x < 180" (Now x = 7, 187, 367... all work due to periodicity)
     
  3. Removed degree/type specifications:
     - Original: "Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3"
     - Invalid Rewrite: "Let P(x) be a polynomial" (Now degree 1, 2, 4... all work)

* Valid MIP Examples (NOT Issue 1):
  - Original: "x = 2, xy = 10, find y" -> Rewrite: "xy = 10, find y"
    (VALID! This is unsolvable logic, distinct from simply removing a "largest" constraint.)

Detection Rule:
1. Does the original ask for "The value", "The maximum", "The unique x"?
2. Does the rewrite lose the condition that locks this answer?
3. Can I now provide ANY random number and claim it's a valid answer? (If YES -> INVALID)

Issue 2: Mathematical Errors or Value Changes

The rewriting process must NEVER change numbers, flip signs, or create illegal operations.

**Critical Rules:**
- Numbers must NEVER be changed: 0.25 cannot become -0.25
- Signs must NEVER be flipped: log(x) cannot become log(-x)
- Operations must remain valid: sqrt(x) requires x ≥ 0

**❌ Examples of Mathematical Errors:**
1. Changed "log(0.25)" to "log(-0.25)"
   → INVALID: Introduced undefined operation (log of negative number)

2. Changed "x > 0" to "x < 0" in a problem with sqrt(x)
   → INVALID: Makes sqrt(x) undefined for the domain

3. Changed "sin(30°)" to "sin(-30°)"
   → INVALID: Flipped the sign, altering the mathematical value

**Detection Rule:**
- Compare all numbers, signs, and operations between original and rewrite
- ANY difference → INVALID

---

**Issue 3: Assumptions or Fixed Parameters Deleted**

Fixed assumptions and parameters (using "Assume", "Let", "Suppose") are NOT removable conditions. They are essential context that defines the problem setup.

**❌ Invalid Example (Assumption Deleted):**
- Original: "A firecracker explodes into pieces. Find the speed of piece A. Assume g = 10 m/s²."
- Invalid Rewrite: "A firecracker explodes into pieces. Find the speed of piece A."
- Why Invalid: "g = 10" is a fixed parameter assumption, not a variable condition

**Trigger Phrases to Watch:**
- "Assume", "Suppose", "Let's say", "Given that"
- "For example", "For instance", "e.g.", "such as"
- "Note that", "It is known that"

**Detection Rule:**
- If the original contains assumption phrases and they're removed → INVALID
- These provide essential context and cannot be treated as removable conditions

---

### Verification Steps

**Step 1: Check Issue 1 (Uniquely Solvable → Unsolvable vs. Infinitely Solvable)**
- Does removing the condition break a dependency (cannot derive answer)? → VALID
- Or does it remove a uniqueness constraint (infinite answers now valid)? → INVALID

**Step 2: Check Issue 2 (Mathematical Errors)**
- Are all numbers, signs, and operations identical between original and rewrite?
- Any difference → INVALID

**Step 3: Check Issue 3 (Assumptions Deleted)**
- Does the original contain "Assume", "For example", or similar phrases?
- Are they preserved in the rewrite? If not → INVALID
