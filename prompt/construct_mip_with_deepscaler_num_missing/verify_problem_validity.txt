You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem quality.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem is a VALID Missing Information Problem (MIP).

### Core Understanding of MIP

A Valid MIP must be UNSOLVABLE due to logical dependency failure.
* The Logic: A necessary piece of information is missing, breaking the computation chain. The model cannot derive the answer and should state "insufficient information."
* The Goal: Test if the model can detect logical dependencies (e.g., "I cannot find Y because I don't know X").

An Invalid MIP becomes OPEN-ENDED (infinite/arbitrary valid answers).
* The Error: Removing constraints like "maximum", "unique", or "the only" allows ANY number fitting the loose description to be technically correct. This does NOT test logical reasoning.

### Verification Criteria

Check if the rewritten problem has any of these THREE CRITICAL ISSUES.

---

### Issue 1: Logical Break vs. Open-Endedness

**The Core Distinction:**

✅ **Valid MIP** = Removes information → **Computation blocked** → Cannot derive answer
❌ **Invalid MIP** = Removes constraints → **Lost uniqueness** → Infinite valid answers

---

**❌ INVALID: Removes Uniqueness/Specificity Constraints**

The original asks for a UNIQUE, SPECIFIC answer, but removing the condition makes the problem open-ended with infinitely many valid solutions.

**Common Invalid Patterns:**

1. **Removed specificity keywords:**
   - Original: "Find THE LARGEST prime divisor of 84"
   - Invalid Rewrite: "Find a prime divisor of 84"
   - Why Invalid: Now 2, 3, 7 are all "correct" answers → Not testing logical dependency, just removed "largest" constraint

2. **Removed domain/range constraints:**
   - Original: "Solve tan(53°)tan(81°)tan(x°) = tan(53°) + tan(81°) + tan(x°) where 0° < x < 180°"
   - Invalid Rewrite: Removed "0° < x < 180°"
   - Why Invalid: Due to periodicity, x = 7°, 187°, 367°, 547°... all work → Infinite solutions

3. **Removed degree/type specifications:**
   - Original: "Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3 such that P(1)=5, P(2)=8, P(3)=13"
   - Invalid Rewrite: "Let P(x) be a polynomial such that P(1)=5, P(2)=8, P(3)=13"
   - Why Invalid: Now polynomials of degree 2, 3, 4, 5... all can satisfy these points → Not uniquely determined

4. **Removed integer/type constraints:**
   - Original: "Find the positive INTEGER n such that n² < 50"
   - Invalid Rewrite: "Find n such that n² < 50"
   - Why Invalid: Now n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 OR 1.5, 2.7, π, √10... → Infinite solutions

---

**✅ VALID: Creates Logical Dependency Break**

Removing the condition makes it IMPOSSIBLE to compute the answer, even though the problem still asks for a unique/specific value.

**Valid Examples:**

1. **Dependency chain broken:**
   - Original: "Given x = 2 and xy = 10, find y"
   - Valid Rewrite: "Given xy = 10, find y"
   - Why Valid: Cannot compute y without knowing x → True logical break (not just "find THE y" removed)

2. **Required intermediate value missing:**
   - Original: "Triangle ABC has area 50 and base 10. Find the height"
   - Valid Rewrite: "Triangle ABC has base 10. Find the height"
   - Why Valid: Cannot derive height without area → Computation blocked

3. **Formula parameter missing:**
   - Original: "A car travels at speed v for time t=5 hours, covering distance d=300 km. Find v"
   - Valid Rewrite: "A car travels at speed v for time t=5 hours. Find v"
   - Why Valid: Cannot compute v without distance d → Missing necessary input

---

**Detection Rule for Issue 1:**

Ask these questions in order:

1. **Does the original ask for "THE value", "THE maximum", "THE unique x", "THE integer n"?**
   - If NO → Likely valid (already asking for derivation, not selection)
   - If YES → Continue to step 2

2. **What does the removed condition do?**
   - If it provides a VALUE/FACT needed for calculation → Valid (logical break)
   - If it specifies WHICH answer to select (largest, smallest, unique, integer) → Invalid (constraint removal)

3. **Test: Can I now provide ANY random number and claim it's valid?**
   - If YES → **INVALID** (open-ended)
   - If NO, I genuinely cannot compute the answer → **VALID** (logical dependency failure)

---

### Issue 2: Mathematical Errors or Value Changes

The rewriting process must NEVER change numbers, flip signs, or create illegal operations.

**Critical Rules:**
- Numbers must NEVER be changed: 0.25 cannot become -0.25
- Signs must NEVER be flipped: log(x) cannot become log(-x)
- Operations must remain valid: sqrt(x) requires x ≥ 0

**❌ Examples of Mathematical Errors:**

1. **Changed numerical values:**
   - Original: "log(0.25)"
   - Invalid Rewrite: "log(-0.25)"
   - Why Invalid: Introduced undefined operation (log of negative number) + changed the value

2. **Flipped inequality direction:**
   - Original: "x > 0" in a problem with sqrt(x)
   - Invalid Rewrite: "x < 0"
   - Why Invalid: Makes sqrt(x) undefined for the new domain

3. **Changed signs:**
   - Original: "sin(30°)"
   - Invalid Rewrite: "sin(-30°)"
   - Why Invalid: Flipped the sign, altering the mathematical value

**Detection Rule for Issue 2:**
- Compare ALL numbers, signs, operations, and inequality directions
- ANY difference → **INVALID**

---

### Issue 3: Assumptions or Fixed Parameters Deleted

Fixed assumptions and parameters (marked by "Assume", "Let", "Suppose") are NOT removable conditions. They define the problem's context.

**❌ Invalid Example:**

- Original: "A firecracker explodes into pieces. Find the speed of piece A. Assume g = 10 m/s²."
- Invalid Rewrite: "A firecracker explodes into pieces. Find the speed of piece A."
- Why Invalid: "Assume g = 10" is a fixed parameter, not a variable condition to remove

**Trigger Phrases (Cannot Be Removed):**
- "Assume", "Suppose", "Let's say", "Given that"
- "For example", "For instance", "e.g.", "such as"  
- "Note that", "It is known that"
- "Let [variable] be [definition]"

**Detection Rule for Issue 3:**
- If the original contains assumption/definition phrases → They must remain in rewrite
- If removed → **INVALID**

---

### Verification Steps

**Step 1: Check Issue 1 (Logical Break vs. Open-Endedness)**
- Does removing the condition break a calculation dependency? → VALID
- Or does it remove a uniqueness/specificity constraint allowing infinite solutions? → INVALID

**Step 2: Check Issue 2 (Mathematical Errors)**
- Are all numbers, signs, operations, and inequalities identical?
- Any difference → INVALID

**Step 3: Check Issue 3 (Assumptions Preserved)**
- Does the original contain "Assume", "Let", "For example", etc.?
- Are they preserved in the rewrite? If not → INVALID

### Output Format

### Analysis ###
[2-4 sentences analyzing the three issues:
1. Does removal create logical dependency break (VALID) or open-endedness (INVALID)?
2. Are there any mathematical errors or value changes?
3. Are assumptions/fixed parameters preserved?]

### Judgement ###
