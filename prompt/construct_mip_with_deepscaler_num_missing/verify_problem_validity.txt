You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem quality.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem is still a VALID missing information problem (MIP).

### Original Problem ###
{original_question}

### Rewritten Problem ###
{rewritten_question}

### Removed Conditions ###
{removed_conditions}

### Core Understanding of MIP ###

A valid MIP should satisfy:
✅ The rewritten problem is UNSOLVABLE (no unique answer) due to missing information
✅ OR the rewritten problem has INFINITE valid solutions due to missing constraints

The GOAL of MIP is to create problems that:
- Cannot be uniquely solved without the removed conditions
- Become solvable when the removed conditions are restored

### Verification Criteria ###

Check if the rewritten problem has any of these **THREE CRITICAL ISSUES**:

---

**Issue 1: Unintended Infinite Solutions**

The original problem asks for a UNIQUE, SPECIFIC answer (e.g., "the largest", "the smallest", "the exact value"), but after removing conditions, it now has infinitely many valid answers WITHOUT changing the nature of the question.

**Key distinction:**
- ✅ VALID: Original asks "Find x" (unique answer) → Rewritten becomes unsolvable (no solution) ← This is the GOAL of MIP!
- ❌ INVALID: Original asks "Find THE largest x" → Rewritten asks "Find x" (many valid answers) ← Question nature changed!

**Common Invalid cases:**

1. **Removed uniqueness specifiers:**
   - Original: "Find THE LARGEST prime divisor"
   - Invalid rewrite: "Find a prime divisor" ← Now any prime divisor works (infinite choices)
   
2. **Removed domain constraints that prevent infinite solutions:**
   - Original: "tan(53°)tan(81°)tan(x°) = ... where 0 < x < 180"
   - Invalid rewrite: Removed "0 < x < 180" → Now x = 7°, 187°, 367°, ... all work (periodic function)
   
3. **Removed degree/type specifications:**
   - Original: "Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3"
   - Invalid rewrite: "Let P(x) be a polynomial" ← Now degree 1, 2, 3, 4, ... all work

**IMPORTANT - Valid MIP examples (NOT Issue 1):**
- Original: "x = 2, xy = 10, find y" → Rewrite: "xy = 10, find y"
  ✅ VALID! The problem now has infinite solutions (y can be anything if we also change x), which is exactly the goal of MIP.

- Original: "Circle with center (0,0) and radius 5" → Rewrite: "Circle with center (0,0)"
  ✅ VALID! Now we can't determine the exact circle, but it's still a valid MIP.

**How to detect Issue 1:**
1. Check if original problem uses uniqueness keywords: "the largest", "the smallest", "the unique", "the only"
2. Check if these keywords are preserved in the rewritten problem
3. If removed AND this causes infinite valid answers → Invalid

---

**Issue 2: Mathematical Errors Introduced**

The rewriting process introduced mathematically ILLEGAL operations or CHANGED numerical values.

**Critical rules:**
1. **Numbers must NEVER be changed**: 0.25 cannot become -0.25, 10 cannot become -10
2. **Signs must NEVER be flipped**: log(x) cannot become log(-x), √a cannot become √(-a)
3. **No illegal operations should be introduced**

**Common errors:**

Type A: **Numbers or signs were modified** (This should NEVER happen!)
- Changed "log(0.25)" to "log(-0.25)" ❌ ← Number sign flipped!
- Changed "x > 0" to "x < 0" when problem has √x ❌ ← Makes √x illegal!
- Changed "sin(30°)" to "sin(-30°)" ❌ ← Sign flipped!

Type B: **Domain constraint removed, making operations illegal**
- Original: "For x > 0, compute log(x)" → Removed "x > 0"
- Now if we try x = -1, log(-1) is illegal ❌

**How to detect Issue 2:**
1. Check if ANY numbers in the rewritten problem differ from the original (should NOT happen!)
2. Check if ANY signs are flipped (should NOT happen!)
3. Check if removing domain constraints makes some operations undefined

**Valid examples (NOT Issue 2):**
- Original: "x = 5, y = 10" → Removed "x = 5"
  ✅ VALID! Only removed a condition, didn't change any numbers
  
- Original: "For x > 0, compute x²" → Removed "x > 0"
  ✅ VALID! x² is still legal for x ≤ 0

---

**Issue 3: Examples or Assumptions Deleted**

The original problem contains illustrative examples or explicit assumptions (using phrases like "For example", "For instance", "e.g.", "Assume"), but the rewritten problem removed them.

**Key understanding:**
- Examples are NOT conditions - they are CONTEXT to help understand the problem
- Assumptions (e.g., "Assume g = 10 m/s²") are NOT removable conditions - they are fixed parameters
- Removing examples makes the problem ambiguous or unsolvable

**Example of Issue 3 - Type A (Example deleted):**

Original: "On a computer keyboard, the key for the digit 1 is not working. **For example, if you try to type the number 1231234, only the number 23234 will actually print.**\n\nSasha tried to type an 8-digit number, but only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers satisfy this condition?"

Invalid Rewrite: "On a computer keyboard, a certain key is not working. Sasha tried to type an 8-digit number, but only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers satisfy this condition?"

Why Invalid: The example "1231234 → 23234" shows that digit "1" is the non-working key. Without this example, we can't determine which key is broken! ❌

**Example of Issue 3 - Type B (Assumption deleted):**

Original: "A firecracker was thrown vertically upward with a speed of 20 m/s. One second after the flight began, it exploded into two unequal parts. Find the speed of the second fragment. **Assume the acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s².**"

Invalid Rewrite: "A firecracker was thrown vertically upward with a speed of 20 m/s. One second after the flight began, it exploded into two unequal parts. Find the speed of the second fragment."

Why Invalid: The assumption "g = 10 m/s²" was deleted. Without this, we can't solve the problem! ❌

**Trigger phrases to check:**
- "For example", "For instance", "e.g.", "such as", "like"
- "Assume", "Suppose", "Let's say", "Given that"
- "Illustration:", "Example:", "Consider the case"

**How to detect Issue 3:**
1. Search for trigger phrases in the original problem
2. Check if these sections are preserved in the rewritten problem
3. Check if removed_conditions contains any example text (should NOT!)

### Analysis Instructions ###

Analyze step by step:

**Step 1: Check Issue 1 (Unintended Infinite Solutions)**
- Does the original problem ask for a UNIQUE/SPECIFIC answer using words like "the largest", "the smallest", "the exact"?
- Did the rewriting remove these uniqueness specifiers?
- If yes → Does this create infinite valid answers? (If yes → Invalid)

**Step 2: Check Issue 2 (Mathematical Errors)**
- Were any numbers changed? (e.g., 0.25 → -0.25) → If yes, Invalid
- Were any signs flipped? (e.g., x > 0 → x < 0) → If yes, Invalid  
- Does removing constraints make operations illegal? (e.g., removed x > 0 but kept log(x)) → If yes, Invalid

**Step 3: Check Issue 3 (Examples or Assumptions Deleted)**
- Does the original contain "For example", "Assume", or similar phrases?
- Are these preserved in the rewritten problem?
- If deleted → Invalid

### Output Format ###

First, provide your analysis after ### Analysis ###. Keep it concise (2-6 sentences).

### Analysis ###
[Analyze each of the three issues systematically:
- Issue 1: Does it create unintended infinite solutions?
- Issue 2: Were numbers/signs changed or illegal operations introduced?
- Issue 3: Were examples or assumptions deleted?]

Then, output your judgement after ### Judgement ###.

### Judgement ###
Valid or Invalid

**Judgement Rules:**
- Output "Valid" if ALL three checks pass
- Output "Invalid" if ANY of Issue 1, Issue 2, or Issue 3 occurs
