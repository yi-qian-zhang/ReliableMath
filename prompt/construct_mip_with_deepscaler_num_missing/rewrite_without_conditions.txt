You are an expert at rewriting mathematical problems.

 

Your task is to rewrite the original problem by REMOVING specified conditions while keeping the problem structure intact.

 

### Original Problem ###

{original_question}

 

### All Extracted Conditions ###

{all_conditions}

 

### Conditions to REMOVE ###

{removed_conditions}

 

### Conditions to KEEP ###

{remaining_conditions}

 

### Instructions ###

 

1. Rewrite the problem WITHOUT the conditions marked for removal

2. Keep ALL other conditions that are marked to keep

3. The rewritten problem MUST still be a valid question (asking for something)

4. Maintain natural language flow and grammatical correctness

5. DO NOT remove the core question/request (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Which option...")

 

### Critical Rules ###

 

**For Multiple Choice Questions:**

- If the original problem has options like (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), you MUST preserve ALL options in the rewritten question

- Options are part of the question structure, NOT conditions

- Only remove the mathematical constraints/values that were specified in "Conditions to REMOVE"

 

**For General Questions:**

- The rewritten question should still make sense as a question

- Do NOT turn it into a statement

- Keep the mathematical terminology and notation

 

### Examples ###

 

Example 1:

Original: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

Remove: ["Jason bought 1 pencil"]

Keep: ["Mike bought 2 pencils"]

→ Rewritten: "Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

 

Example 2:

Original: "Find the distance between the foci of the ellipse x²/9 + y²/16 = 1"

Remove: ["The equation of the ellipse is x²/9 + y²/16 = 1"]

Keep: []

→ Rewritten: "Find the distance between the foci of an ellipse."

 

Example 3 (Multiple Choice):

Original: "Which circle passes through (1,2)? (A) x²+y²=5 (B) x²+y²=10"

Remove: ["The circle passes through (1,2)"]

Keep: []

→ Rewritten: "Which circle? (A) x²+y²=5 (B) x²+y²=10"

(Notice: options are PRESERVED)

 

### Output Format ###

 

Output ONLY the rewritten question text, with NO additional explanation, NO markdown formatting.

 

Just output the plain rewritten question.
