You are an expert at rewriting mathematical problems.

Your task is to rewrite the original problem by REMOVING specified conditions while keeping the problem structure intact.

### Original Problem ###
{original_question}

### All Extracted Conditions ###
{all_conditions}

### Conditions to REMOVE ###
{removed_conditions}

### Conditions to KEEP ###
{remaining_conditions}

### Instructions ###
1. Rewrite the problem WITHOUT the conditions marked for removal
2. Keep ALL other conditions that are marked to keep
3. The rewritten problem MUST still be a valid question (asking for something)
4. Maintain natural language flow and grammatical correctness
5. DO NOT remove the core question/request (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Which option...")

### Critical Rules ###

**For Multiple Choice Questions:**
- If the original problem has options like (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), you MUST preserve ALL options in the rewritten question
- Options are part of the question structure, NOT conditions
- Only remove the mathematical constraints/values that were specified in "Conditions to REMOVE"

**For General Questions:**
- The rewritten question should still make sense as a question
- Do NOT turn it into a statement
- Keep the mathematical terminology and notation

### Examples ###

Example 1:
original_question: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Remove: ["Jason bought 1 pencil"]
Keep: ["Mike bought 2 pencils"]
→ Rewritten: "Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

Example 2:
original_question: "Find the distance between the foci of the ellipse x²/9 + y²/16 = 1"
Remove: ["The equation of the ellipse is x²/9 + y²/16 = 1"]
Keep: []
→ Rewritten: "Find the distance between the foci of an ellipse."

Example 3 (Multiple Choice):
original_question: "Which circle passes through (1,2)? (A) x²+y²=5 (B) x²+y²=10"
Remove: ["The circle passes through (1,2)"]
Keep: []
→ Rewritten: "Which circle? (A) x²+y²=5 (B) x²+y²=10"
(Notice: options are PRESERVED)

NOT DO THIS:
original_question: "On a computer keyboard, the key for the digit 1 is not working. For example, if you try to type the number 1231234, only the number 23234 will actually print.\n\nSasha tried to type an 8-digit number, but only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers satisfy this condition?",
Remove: ["The key for the digit 1 is not working","Sasha tried to type an 8-digit number"]
Keep: ["Only 202020 was printed"]
Rewritten: "Only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers satisfy this condition?"  ❌
(Notice: donnot delete examples in Original Problem)


### Output Format ###
You need to output TWO parts:

**Part 1: Analysis**
Think step by step to explain how you make the problem unsolvable after removing the condition(s).
Output your analysis after ### Analysis ###. Keep it concise (1-3 sentences) and within \\analysis{{}}.

**Part 2: Rewritten Question**
Given your analysis, output the rewritten mathematical question after ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any thinking process or <think> tags. Only output the structured format below:**

### Analysis ###
[Your analysis of why the problem becomes unsolvable]

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###
[The rewritten question text only, no additional formatting]
