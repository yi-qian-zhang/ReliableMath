You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem rewriting.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem ONLY removed the specified conditions while keeping ALL other conditions unchanged.

### Original Problem ###
{original_question}

### Rewritten Problem ###
{rewritten_question}

### Conditions That Should Be REMOVED ###
{removed_conditions}

### Conditions That Should Be KEPT ###
{remaining_conditions}

### Verification Criteria ###

Check the following:
1. ✓ The rewritten problem removed ONLY the specified conditions
2. ✓ The rewritten problem kept ALL other conditions unchanged
3. ✓ The rewritten problem did NOT add any new conditions
4. ✓ The core question/request is preserved (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Which...")

### Output Format ###
