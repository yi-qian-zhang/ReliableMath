You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem rewriting.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem ONLY removed the specified conditions while keeping ALL other content unchanged.

### Original Problem ###
{original_question}

### Rewritten Problem ###
{rewritten_question}

### Conditions That Should Be REMOVED ###
{removed_conditions}

### Conditions That Should Be KEPT ###
{remaining_conditions}

### Verification Criteria ###

Check the following **STRICT REQUIREMENTS**:

**Requirement 1: Removed ONLY Specified Conditions**
- The rewritten problem should remove ONLY the conditions listed in "Conditions That Should Be REMOVED"
- NO other conditions, constraints, or information should be removed

**Requirement 2: Kept ALL Other Conditions Unchanged**
- All conditions in "Conditions That Should Be KEPT" must appear in the rewritten problem
- They should be EXACTLY the same (no paraphrasing, no simplification)

**Requirement 3: No New Conditions Added**
- The rewritten problem should NOT introduce any new constraints or conditions
- No assumptions or clarifications should be added

**Requirement 4: Core Question Preserved**
- The question itself (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Determine...") must remain
- The rewritten text must still be a valid mathematical question

**Requirement 5: Mathematical Expressions Unchanged** ⭐ CRITICAL
- ALL numbers, equations, variables, operators must stay EXACTLY the same
- NO substitutions, simplifications, or alterations allowed
- Examples of INVALID changes:
  - 0.25 → -0.25 ❌ (sign changed)
  - log(0.25) → log(2.5) ❌ (number changed)
  - x²/9 + y²/16 = 1 → x²/16 + y²/9 = 1 ❌ (coefficients swapped)

**Requirement 6: Examples Must Be Preserved** ⭐ CRITICAL
- If the original problem contains illustrative examples (introduced by "For example", "For instance", "e.g.", "such as"), these examples are PART OF THE PROBLEM CONTEXT
- Examples should NEVER be removed (even if a condition is removed)
- Example:
  ```
  Original: "On a keyboard, key 1 is broken. For example, typing 1231234 prints 23234."
  If removing "key 1 is broken":
  WRONG: "On a keyboard, a key is broken."  ← Example deleted!
  RIGHT: "On a keyboard, a key is broken. For example, typing 1231234 prints 23234."
  ```

### Analysis Instructions ###

Analyze step by step:

**Step 1: What was removed?**
- List everything that was deleted from the original problem
- Check if ONLY the specified conditions were removed
- Check if any examples were accidentally deleted

**Step 2: What was kept?**
- Verify all "Conditions That Should Be KEPT" appear in the rewritten problem
- Check if they are exactly the same (no modifications)

**Step 3: Were expressions altered?**
- Compare all mathematical expressions (numbers, equations, formulas)
- Check if any numbers were changed, signs flipped, or operations modified

**Step 4: Was anything added?**
- Check if any new conditions, assumptions, or clarifications were introduced

**Step 5: Is it still a question?**
- Verify the core question (Find/Calculate/Determine) is preserved

### Output Format ###

First, provide your analysis after ### Analysis ###.

### Analysis ###
[Systematically check Requirements 1-6 and explain what was changed]

Then, output your judgement after ### Judgement ###.

### Judgement ###
True or False

(Output "True" ONLY if ALL six requirements are satisfied)
(Output "False" if ANY requirement is violated)
