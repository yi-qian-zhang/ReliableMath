You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem quality.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem is still a VALID mathematical question that is unsolvable (not solvable with infinite solutions).

### Original Problem ###
{original_question}

### Rewritten Problem ###
{rewritten_question}

### Removed Conditions ###
{removed_conditions}

### Verification Criteria ###

Check if the rewritten problem has any of these ISSUES:

**Issue 1: Question Stem Deleted**
- The core question itself was removed (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Determine...")
- The rewritten text is no longer asking a mathematical question
- Example BAD: "A triangle ABC" (not a question!)
- Example GOOD: "A triangle ABC. Find the area." (still a question)

**Issue 2: Infinite Solutions (Not Unsolvable)**
- After removing conditions, the problem has infinitely many valid answers
- This is DIFFERENT from unsolvable (where we can't determine a specific answer)
- Example: "Find a number x" (infinite solutions: any number works)
- We want: UNSOLVABLE (missing info to solve)
- We DON'T want: INFINITE SOLUTIONS (too many valid answers)

**Issue 3: Trivially Solvable**
- The problem became too easy and can be solved without the removed conditions
- Example: Removed a red herring that wasn't actually needed

### Analysis Instructions ###

Think step by step:
1. Does the rewritten problem still ask a clear mathematical question?
2. After removing the conditions, is the problem unsolvable OR does it have infinite solutions?
3. Can the problem still be answered without the removed conditions?

### Output Format ###

First, provide your analysis after ### Analysis ###.

### Analysis ###
[Analyze whether the rewritten problem has any of the issues above]

Then, output your judgement after ### Judgement ###.

### Judgement ###
Valid or Invalid

(Output "Valid" if the rewritten problem is a proper unsolvable question)
(Output "Invalid" if it has Issue 1, Issue 2, or Issue 3)
