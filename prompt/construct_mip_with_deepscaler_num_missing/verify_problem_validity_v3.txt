You are an expert verifier for mathematical problem quality.

 

Your task is to verify that the rewritten problem is still a VALID missing information problem (MIP).

 

### Original Problem ###

{original_question}

 

### Rewritten Problem ###

{rewritten_question}

 

### Removed Conditions ###

{removed_conditions}

 

### Verification Criteria ###

 

Check if the rewritten problem has any of these **THREE CRITICAL ISSUES**:

 

**Issue 1: Unique Solution → Infinite Solutions**

The original problem has a unique answer, but after removing conditions, it now has infinitely many valid answers.

 

**Common cases:**

- Removed domain constraints (e.g., "0 < x < 180" from trigonometric equations)

  Example: "tan(53°)tan(81°)tan(x°) = ..." with constraint "0 < x < 180"

  → After removing constraint: infinite solutions due to periodicity ❌

 

- Removed degree/type specifications (e.g., "monic polynomial of degree 3" → "polynomial")

  Example: "Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3"

  → After removing "degree 3": infinitely many polynomials possible ❌

 

- Removed uniqueness conditions (e.g., "the largest", "positive", "integer")

  Example: "Find the largest prime divisor" → "Find a prime divisor"

  → Multiple divisors exist ❌

 

**How to detect:**

- Ask: "Does the original problem have ONE specific answer?"

- Ask: "After removing these conditions, are there MANY valid answers?"

- If answer changes from "one" to "many/infinite" → Invalid

 

**Issue 2: Mathematical Errors Introduced**

The rewriting process introduced mathematically illegal operations.

 

**Common errors:**

- Logarithm of negative numbers: log(-0.25), ln(-x) where x > 0

- Division by zero: 1/0, tan(90°)

- Even roots of negative real numbers: √(-4) in real domain

- Out-of-domain operations: arcsin(2), arccos(-1.5)

- Negative numbers raised to non-integer powers in real domain

 

**Examples:**

- Changed "log(0.25)" to "log(-0.25)" ❌ (negative logarithm)

- Changed "x > 0" to "x < 0" in context of √x ❌ (negative square root)

 

**How to detect:**

- Check if any numbers in mathematical expressions were changed (should NOT happen)

- Check if domain constraints were removed, making operations invalid

 

**Issue 3: Examples Deleted**

The original problem contains illustrative examples (using phrases like "For example", "For instance", "e.g."), but the rewritten problem removed them.

 

**Examples are PART OF THE PROBLEM CONTEXT and should NEVER be removed.**

 

**Example of Issue 3:**

Original: "On a computer keyboard, the key for the digit 1 is not working. **For example, if you try to type the number 1231234, only the number 23234 will actually print.**\n\nSasha tried to type an 8-digit number, but only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers satisfy this condition?"

 

Invalid Rewrite: "On a computer keyboard, a certain key is not working. Sasha tried to type an 8-digit number, but only 202020 was printed. How many 8-digit numbers satisfy this condition?"

→ The example "1231234 → 23234" was deleted ❌

 

**How to detect:**

- Check if original problem contains phrases: "For example", "For instance", "e.g.", "such as", "Example:"

- Check if these example sections are preserved in the rewritten problem

- Examples should NOT be in the removed_conditions list (they are context, not conditions)

 

### Analysis Instructions ###

 

Analyze step by step:

 

**Step 1: Check Issue 1 (Unique → Infinite)**

- Does removing these conditions change a unique-answer problem into an infinite-answer problem?

- Consider: domain constraints, degree specifications, uniqueness keywords

 

**Step 2: Check Issue 2 (Mathematical Errors)**

- Were any mathematical expressions altered (numbers changed, signs flipped)?

- Do any operations become mathematically illegal after removing domain constraints?

 

**Step 3: Check Issue 3 (Examples Deleted)**

- Does the original problem contain examples (look for "For example", "e.g.", etc.)?

- Are these examples preserved in the rewritten problem?

 

### Output Format ###

 

First, provide your analysis after ### Analysis ###.


### Analysis ###

[Analyze each of the three issues systematically]

Then, output your judgement after ### Judgement ###.


### Judgement ###

Valid or Invalid

(Output "Valid" ONLY if ALL three checks pass: no infinite solutions, no math errors, examples preserved)

(Output "Invalid" if ANY of Issue 1, Issue 2, or Issue 3 occurs)
