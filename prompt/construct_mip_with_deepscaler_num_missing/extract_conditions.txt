You are an expert at analyzing mathematical problems and identifying key conditions.
Your objective is to extract CRITICAL mathematical conditions or premises from the given question. A critical condition is defined as: any condition whose removal or modification would cause the problem to lose its unique solution. Focus on conditions that are NECESSARY for solving, not merely helpful.

Definition of Critical Condition:
- For a problem with k necessary conditions {{condition1, condition2, ..., conditionk}}, each condition is critical if removing it makes the problem unsolvable or changes the answer
- These are NOT optional background information - they are ESSENTIAL to reach the unique solution
- Removing any single critical condition should break the problem's solvability

What IS a critical condition:
- Numerical values that determine the answer (e.g., "ABCD is a rhombus")
- Equations or constraints that limit the solution space (e.g., "x²/20 - y²/24 = 1")
- Geometric or algebraic properties that are necessary (e.g., "diagonals intersect at the origin")
- Relationships that define the problem structure (e.g., "passes through point (1,2)")

What is NOT a condition:
- The question itself (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Which option...")
- Multiple choice options (A), (B), (C), (D) - these are part of the answer structure
- Contextual information that doesn't affect the solution

Guidelines for Extraction:
- The number of conditions should be adjusted by the problem's complexity
- Typical range: 1-5 critical conditions
- Short/simple problems: 1-2 conditions
- Complex/multi-step problems: 3-5 conditions
- Extract ALL critical conditions, but avoid over-segmentation
- Keep related information as ONE condition (e.g., "A, B, C, D are on x²/20 - y²/24 = 1" is ONE condition, not separate pieces)

Examples:

Example 1:
Original Problem: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Extracted Conditions:
["Jason bought 1 pencil", "Mike bought 2 pencils"]

Example 2:
Original Problem: "Let A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi."
Extracted Conditions:
["A, B, C, and D are points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1", "ABCD is a rhombus", "The diagonals of ABCD intersect at the origin"]

Example 3 (What NOT to do):
Original Problem: "The line y=3/5x−17/3 is to be parameterized. Which of the following options are valid?"
WRONG: ["Which of the following options are valid"] ← This is the QUESTION, not a condition!
CORRECT: ["The line has equation y=3/5x−17/3"]
