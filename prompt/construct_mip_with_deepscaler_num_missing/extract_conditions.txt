Analyze the following mathematical problem and generate removal variants.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Ground Truth Answer: {ground_truth}

Task:
1. Identify ALL conditions in the problem
2. For EACH condition, create a variant where that condition is removed
3. Rewrite the problem without that specific condition

Instructions:
- A condition is any piece of information that could help solve the problem
- A condition includes: numerical values, equations, constraints, relationships, or background facts
- A condition does NOT include: the question itself (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Which option...","Prove...")
- Each variant should remove exactly ONE condition
- The rewritten problem should be natural and grammatically correct
- The rewritten problem MUST still be a question (asking something)
- Keep all other conditions unchanged in each variant

CRITICAL RULE:
- DO NOT remove the core question/request from the problem
- Only remove supporting information (numbers, equations, constraints)
- If the problem is a multiple-choice question with options (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), you MUST keep ALL the options in the incomplete_question.
- The options themselves are NOT conditions - they are part of the question structure.
- Only remove mathematical conditions that affect which options are correct,such as equations, constraints, or given values.


Example 1:

Original Problem: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

Conditions identified:
1. Jason bought 1 pencil
2. Mike bought 2 pencils

Variants to generate:

Variant 1 (remove condition 1):
- Removed: "Jason bought 1 pencil"
- Remaining: ["Mike bought 2 pencils"]
- Incomplete Question: "Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

Variant 2 (remove condition 2):
- Removed: "Mike bought 2 pencils"  
- Remaining: ["Jason bought 1 pencil"]
- Incomplete Question: "Jason bought 1 pencil. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

Example 2 (What NOT to do):

Original Problem: "Find the distance between the foci of the ellipse 36x²+16y²=8"

WRONG - Do NOT do this:
- Removed: "Find the distance between the foci"  ← This is the QUESTION, not a condition!
- Incomplete Question: "The ellipse 36x²+16y²=8"  ← This is NOT a question anymore!

CORRECT - Do this instead:
- Removed: "The equation of the ellipse is 36x²+16y²=8"  ← This is a condition
- Incomplete Question: "Find the distance between the foci of an ellipse"  ← Still a question!

Example 3 (What NOT to do):

Original Problem: "The line y=3/5x−17/3 is to be parameterized. Which of the following options are valid?"

WRONG - Do NOT do this:
- Removed: "Which of the following options are valid"  ← This is the QUESTION!
- Incomplete Question: "The line y=3/5x−17/3 is to be parameterized"  ← NOT asking anything!

CORRECT - Do this instead:
- Removed: "The equation of the line is y=3/5x−17/3"  ← This is a condition
- Incomplete Question: "A line is to be parameterized. Which of the following options are valid?"  ← Still asking!

Example 3 (Multiple Choice):
Original: "Which circle passes through (1,2)? (A) x^2+y^2=5 (B) x^2+y^2=10"
Removed condition: "passes through (1,2)"
Incomplete question: "Which circle? (A) x^2+y^2=5 (B) x^2+y^2=10" ← Keep options!

OUTPUT FORMAT:

CRITICAL: Output ONLY a raw JSON array. DO NOT use markdown code blocks, backticks, or any formatting.

Required format - output this EXACTLY:
[
  {{
    "removed_condition": "condition text",
    "remaining_conditions": ["other conditions"],
    "incomplete_question": "rewritten question without the removed condition"
  }},
  {{
    "removed_condition": "another condition",
    "remaining_conditions": ["remaining conditions"],
    "incomplete_question": "another rewritten question"
  }}
]
