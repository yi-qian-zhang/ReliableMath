You are an expert at rewriting mathematical problems to create Missing Information Problems (MIP).

Your task is to rewrite the original problem by REMOVING specified conditions, making the problem UNSOLVABLE while maintaining natural language flow.

### Original Problem ###
{original_question}

### All Extracted Conditions ###
{all_conditions}

### Conditions to REMOVE ###
{removed_conditions}

### Conditions to KEEP ###
{remaining_conditions}

### Core Objective ###
After removing the specified conditions, the rewritten problem should become UNSOLVABLE because critical information is missing. However, the problem should still:
1. Read naturally as a well-formed question
2. Preserve the core question structure (e.g., "Find...", "Calculate...", "Determine...")
3. Keep all remaining conditions intact
4. Maintain grammatical correctness

### Step-by-Step Instructions ###

**Step 1: Understand Why Removal Causes Unsolvability**
Think about how the removed conditions are essential for solving:
- Do they provide necessary numerical values?
- Do they define critical relationships?
- Do they constrain the solution space?

**Step 2: Rewrite While Preserving Structure**
- Remove ONLY the specified conditions from the problem text
- Keep ALL other conditions exactly as they appear
- Ensure the question remains grammatically correct
- For multiple-choice questions, PRESERVE ALL OPTIONS (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)

**Step 3: Verify Natural Flow**
- The rewritten question should NOT feel incomplete or awkward
- It should be a valid mathematical question, just unsolvable due to missing information
- Avoid phrases like "with unknown..." or "without knowing..." - just omit the removed conditions naturally

### Critical Rules ###

**Multiple Choice Questions:**
- Options (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) are NEVER conditions - they are part of the answer structure
- ALWAYS preserve all options in their entirety
- Only remove the constraint/condition text, not the options

**Numerical/Geometric Problems:**
- If removing a value, don't replace with "unknown x" - just omit it
- Maintain variable names and relationships from kept conditions

**Question Integrity:**
- The core question MUST remain (e.g., "Find the area" should stay "Find the area", not become "There is an area")
- Keep mathematical terminology precise

### Examples ###

**Example 1 (Single Condition Removal):**
Original: "A triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=12, and angle B=90°. Find the length of AC."
Remove: ["AB=5"]
Keep: ["BC=12", "angle B=90°"]
→ Rewritten: "A triangle ABC has side BC=12 and angle B=90°. Find the length of AC."
(Why unsolvable: Missing one leg of right triangle)

**Example 2 (Multiple Conditions Removal):**
Original: "A rectangle has length 8 cm and width 5 cm. Find its perimeter."
Remove: ["length 8 cm", "width 5 cm"]
Keep: []
→ Rewritten: "A rectangle. Find its perimeter."
(Why unsolvable: No dimensions provided)

**Example 3 (Multiple Choice with Condition Removal):**
Original: "Which of the following circles passes through point (3,4)? (A) x²+y²=25 (B) x²+y²=16 (C) x²+y²=9"
Remove: ["passes through point (3,4)"]
Keep: []
→ Rewritten: "Which of the following circles? (A) x²+y²=25 (B) x²+y²=16 (C) x²+y²=9"
(Why unsolvable: No criterion to select among circles)
(Notice: All options PRESERVED)


### Output Format ###
Output ONLY the rewritten question in plain text.
- NO explanations
- NO analysis text
- NO markdown formatting (no ###, **, etc.)
- NO phrases like "Rewritten Question:" or "Answer:"

Just the clean mathematical question.
