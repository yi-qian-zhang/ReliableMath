You are a good mathematical question rewriter.

Given a mathematical question ### Original Mathematical Question ###, the answer to the question is ### Original Answer ###, and ### Conditions to Remove ### are key mathematical conditions extracted from the question.

Your objective is to draw inspiration from the ### Original Mathematical Question ### and ### Original Answer ### to rewrite a new math question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### with the following two requirements:

1) The new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### needs to remove ALL the conditions listed in ### Conditions to Remove ### from the ### Original Mathematical Question ###. Maintain the rest of the conditions from ### Conditions to Keep ### unchanged.

2) After removing the conditions in ### Conditions to Remove ###, the new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### should become unsolvable (not just have multiple answers, but truly unsolvable without those conditions).

### Original Mathematical Question ###:
{original_question}

### Original Answer ###:
{ground_truth}

### All Extracted Conditions ###:
{all_conditions}

### Conditions to Remove ###:
{removed_conditions}

### Conditions to Keep ###:
{remaining_conditions}

Think step by step to explain how you make the problem unsolvable after removing the conditions in ### Conditions to Remove ###. You only need to directly output your analysis after ### Analysis ###. Simplify your output as much as possible.

### Examples ###

**Example 1: Removing a single condition**

Original Question: "Find the area of a rectangle with length 5 cm and width 3 cm."
Original Answer: "15"
Conditions to Remove: ["length 5 cm"]
Conditions to Keep: ["width 3 cm"]

### Analysis ###:
By removing the length value (5 cm), we only know the width is 3 cm. Without knowing the length, the area cannot be determined - it could be any value depending on what the length is. This makes the problem unsolvable.

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###:
Find the area of a rectangle with width 3 cm.

**Example 2: Removing multiple conditions**

Original Question: "In triangle ABC where angle A = 60°, side b = 8, and side c = 10, find the length of side a."
Original Answer: "7.21"
Conditions to Remove: ["angle A = 60°", "side b = 8"]
Conditions to Keep: ["side c = 10", "triangle ABC"]

### Analysis ###:
By removing angle A's value and side b's value, we only know side c = 10. In a triangle, knowing just one side length is insufficient to determine the other sides - there are infinitely many triangles with one side equal to 10. Without the angle and another side, the problem becomes unsolvable.

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###:
In triangle ABC where side c = 10, find the length of side a.

**Now, rewrite the given problem:**

### Analysis ###:

<your_analysis_here>

Given your analysis in ### Analysis ### about how you make the problem unsolvable after removing the conditions, you only need to directly output your new mathematical question after ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###. 

**CRITICAL: Output the complete rewritten question as a natural language sentence, NOT as a list or array. The output must be a grammatically correct, readable question - NOT something like [condition1, condition2].**
