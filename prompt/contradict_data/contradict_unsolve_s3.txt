You are an excellent mathematical analyst.

Given:
- **Original Mathematical Question**: The original solvable problem
- **Rewritten Mathematical Question**: The modified problem with contradictory condition
- **Verification Result**: Evidence that the model cannot solve the rewritten problem

Your task is to provide a CONCISE explanation (1-2 sentences) of WHY the contradictory condition makes this problem unsolvable.

**Requirements:**
- Focus on the logical contradiction
- Explain why no valid solution can exist
- Be concise and clear
- Avoid technical jargon when possible

**Example:**
"The problem requires the same variable to simultaneously equal two different values (x=5 and x=7), which is mathematically impossible. This logical contradiction makes the problem have no valid solution."
