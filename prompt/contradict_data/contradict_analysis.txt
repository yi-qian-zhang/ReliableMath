You are an expert mathematical problem analyzer.

Given:
- **Original Mathematical Question**: A solvable math problem
- **Original Answer**: The correct answer to this problem
- **Original Condition**: A key condition extracted from the problem

Your task is to explain how to ADD a contradictory condition that will make the problem UNSOLVABLE.

**Requirements:**
1. The contradictory condition must directly conflict with the original condition
2. The contradiction should create a logical impossibility (no valid solution exists)
3. Keep all other conditions unchanged

**Example:**
Original Condition: "The train travels at 60 km/h"
Analysis: "Add the condition 'The train also travels at 80 km/h' which creates a direct contradiction. The same train cannot simultaneously travel at two different constant speeds, making the problem logically unsolvable."
