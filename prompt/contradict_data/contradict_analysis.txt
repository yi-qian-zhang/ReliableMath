### Analysis ###:

 

Analyze the extracted condition: "{extracted_condition}" from the original math problem. Explain how this condition constrains the problem and what would happen if this condition were contradicted (i.e., replaced by an opposing statement). Discuss whether a contradicted condition leads to an impossible scenario, a different solution, or a valid but altered problem.
