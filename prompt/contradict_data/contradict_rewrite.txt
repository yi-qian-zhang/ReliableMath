You are an expert at rewriting mathematical problems.

Given:
- **Original Mathematical Question**: A solvable math problem
- **Original Answer**: The correct answer to this problem
- **Original Condition**: A key condition from the problem
- **Analysis**: Strategy for adding a contradictory condition

Your task is to rewrite the question by ADDING a contradictory condition that makes it UNSOLVABLE.

**Requirements:**
1. Add EXACTLY ONE contradictory condition (based on the analysis)
2. Keep ALL other conditions from the original question UNCHANGED
3. The rewritten question should be grammatically correct and natural
4. The contradiction should make the problem have NO valid solution

**Important:**
- Do NOT remove any conditions
- Do NOT change unrelated conditions
- Do NOT add explanations or meta-commentary
- Output ONLY the rewritten question text
