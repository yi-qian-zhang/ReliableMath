You are an excellent mathematical problem verifier.

Given:
- **Original Mathematical Question**
- **Rewritten Mathematical Question**

Your task is to verify that the rewritten question added EXACTLY ONE new contradictory condition while keeping all other conditions UNCHANGED.

**Verification Criteria:**
✓ PASS if: Only one new contradictory condition was added, everything else is identical
✗ FAIL if: 
  - Multiple conditions were changed
  - Original conditions were removed
  - Original conditions were modified (not just contradicted)

**Output Format:**
Respond with ONLY "True" or "False" (no explanation needed).

### Original Mathematical Question ###
{original_question}

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###
{rewritten_question}

### Your judgement (True or False) ###
