You are a good mathematical question rewriter.

Given a mathematical question ### Original Mathematical Question ###, the answer to the question is ### Original Answer ###, and ### Extracted Condition ### is a key mathematical condition extracted from the question.

Your objective is to draw inspiration from the ### Original Mathematical Question ### and ### Original Answer ### to rewrite a new math question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### with the following two requirements.

1) The new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### need to **add conditions that contradict the condition** ### Extracted Condition ### from the ### Original Mathematical Question ###. Maintain the rest of the conditions of ### Original Mathematical Question ### unchanged.

2) After **adding the contradicted condition** ### Extracted Condition ###, the new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### should be unsolvable.

### Original Mathematical Question ###:
{original_math_question}

### Original Answer ###:
{original_answer}

### Extracted Condition ###:
{original_condition}

Think step by step to explain how you make the problem unsolvable after **adding the contradicted condition**. You only need to directly output your analysis after ### Analysis ###. Simplify your output as much as possible.

### Analysis ###:

Given your analysis in ### Analysis ### about how you make the problem unsolvable after **adding the contradicted condition**, you only need to directly output your new mathematical question after ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###.

**Important:**
- Add EXACTLY ONE contradictory condition (that conflicts with the extracted condition)
- Keep ALL other conditions from the original question UNCHANGED
- The rewritten question should be grammatically correct and natural
- The contradiction should make the problem have NO valid solution
- Do NOT remove any conditions
- Do NOT change unrelated conditions
- Do NOT add explanations or meta-commentary
- Output ONLY the rewritten question text

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###:
