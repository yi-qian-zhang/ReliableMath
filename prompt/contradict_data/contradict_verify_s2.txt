You are an excellent mathematical problem verifier.

Given:
- **Original Mathematical Question**
- **Original Condition**: The condition from the original problem
- **Rewritten Mathematical Question**: The modified problem with added contradiction

Your task is to extract the NEW CONTRADICTORY CONDITION that was added to the rewritten question.

**Important:**
- This should be the NEW condition that contradicts the original condition
- Not the original condition itself
- Should be a complete, standalone statement

**Example:**
Original Condition: "The car travels at 60 mph"
Rewritten Question: "...the car travels at 60 mph... Additionally, the car travels at 80 mph..."
Contradicted Condition: "The car travels at 80 mph"

### Original Mathematical Question ###
{original_question}

### Original Condition ###
{original_condition}

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###
{rewritten_question}

**Output the contradicted condition (concise, 1-2 sentences):**

### Contradicted Condition ###
