Identify the domain of the question and determine if domain shift is applicable.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Conditions: {conditions}
Question: {question}

**Task**: Analyze the question domain and determine if we can shift it to a different domain.

**Current Domain Types**:
1. **Mathematical/Quantitative**: Asking for numbers, calculations, measurements
   - Examples: "How many?", "What is the distance?", "Calculate the area", "Find the value"
   
2. **Logical/Proof**: Asking to prove or demonstrate something
   - Examples: "Prove that...", "Show that...", "Demonstrate..."

**Target Domain Types** (for shift):
1. **Qualitative/Sensory**: taste, beauty, comfort, appearance
   - Examples: "Which tastes better?", "Is it beautiful?", "Which is more comfortable?"
   
2. **Subjective/Opinion**: preferences, feelings, opinions
   - Examples: "Which do you prefer?", "What do you think?", "Which is better?"
   
3. **Emotional/Psychological**: emotions, mental states
   - Examples: "Is the person happy?", "Are they tired?", "Is it stressful?"
   
4. **Physical Sensation** (non-quantitative): temperature feeling, loudness perception
   - Examples: "Does it feel hot?", "Is it loud?", "Does it hurt?"

**Domain Shift Applicability**:
- **Applicable**: If the question asks for a mathematical/quantitative answer AND the conditions provide quantitative data
- **Not Applicable**: If the question already asks for qualitative/subjective answers, or if it's a proof problem

**Analysis**:

1. What is the current domain of the question?
2. What type of answer does the question expect? (number, proof, explanation)
3. Can we shift this question to a qualitative/subjective domain?
4. If yes, what target domains would be appropriate?
