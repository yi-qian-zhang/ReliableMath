Rewrite the problem by changing ONLY the question to a different domain.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Conditions: {conditions}
Original Question: {question}
Current Domain: {current_domain}
Possible Target Domains: {possible_domains}

**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. Keep ALL conditions EXACTLY as written - WORD FOR WORD, NUMBER FOR NUMBER
2. Change ONLY the question to ask about a different domain
3. The new question must be impossible to answer using the given mathematical conditions

**Domain Change Strategy**:

From Mathematical → To Qualitative:
- "How many apples?" → "Which apple is the sweetest?"
- "What is the distance?" → "Is the journey tiring?"
- "Calculate the area" → "Is the shape beautiful?"
- "Find the speed" → "Is the car going too fast?" (subjective feeling)

From Mathematical → To Subjective:
- "Which class has more students?" → "Which class is more difficult?"
- "What is the total cost?" → "Is it expensive?"
- "How long will it take?" → "Will you be bored during the wait?"

From Mathematical → To Emotional:
- "When will the water boil?" → "Are you anxious while waiting?"
- "How many tasks remain?" → "Do you feel stressed?"

From Mathematical → To Physical Sensation:
- "What is the temperature?" → "Does it feel hot or cold?"
- "How loud is the sound?" → "Does it hurt your ears?"

**Important**:
- The new question should ask about properties that CANNOT be determined from numbers alone
- Keep all entities, objects, and context from the original
- Only change what is being asked about them

**Format**:

Rewrite the problem keeping ALL conditions identical, but change the question to the target domain.
