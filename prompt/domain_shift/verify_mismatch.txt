Verify that the domain mismatch makes the problem genuinely unsolvable.

Rewritten Problem: {rewritten_question}
Original Domain: {original_domain}
Original Answer: {ground_truth}

**Mismatch Analysis**:

1. **Domain Incompatibility**:
   - What domain does the question ask about?
   - What domain do the conditions provide information for?
   - Are these domains fundamentally incompatible?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = completely incompatible)

2. **Impossibility to Answer**:
   - Can the question be answered using ONLY the given conditions?
   - What type of information would be needed to answer the question?
   - Why is this information missing?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = definitely impossible)

3. **Deceptiveness**:
   - Would someone initially think this is a standard problem?
   - Do all the numbers and conditions look relevant?
   - Would someone try to calculate before realizing it's unanswerable?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = very deceptive)

4. **Clear Explanation**:
   - Explain clearly why the mathematical conditions cannot answer the qualitative question
   - Example: "The conditions tell us quantities (5 apples, 3 apples) but the question asks about taste quality, which requires sensory information not provided"

5. **Overall Assessment**:
   - Is this a valid domain mismatch problem?
   - Recommendation: "accept" or "reject"

Output as JSON:
{{
  "domain_incompatibility": 0.90,
  "impossibility": 0.85,
  "deceptiveness": 0.80,
  "explanation": "The conditions provide quantitative data (numbers, distances, times) but the question asks about subjective experience (tiredness, stress, beauty) which cannot be determined from numbers alone.",
  "overall": 0.85,
  "recommendation": "accept"
}}
