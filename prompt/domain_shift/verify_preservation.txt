Verify that the rewrite preserved all conditions and only changed the question domain.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Original Conditions: {original_conditions}
Original Question: {original_question_part}
Rewritten Problem: {rewritten_question}

**Verification Checklist**:

1. **Conditions Preservation** (CRITICAL):
   - Are ALL conditions from the original problem present in the rewritten version?
   - Are ALL numbers exactly the same?
   - Are ALL entities and relationships preserved?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = perfect preservation, 0.0 = conditions changed)

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Extract all numbers from original: [list them]
   - Extract all numbers from rewritten: [list them]
   - Do they match exactly? Yes/No
   - Score: 1.0 if yes, 0.0 if no

3. **Question Domain Changed**:
   - Is the question now asking about a different domain?
   - Has the question changed from quantitative to qualitative/subjective?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = clear domain change)

4. **Natural Language**:
   - Is the rewritten problem grammatically correct?
   - Does it sound natural and realistic?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0

5. **Overall Quality**:
   - Average of above scores
   - Is this a valid domain shift transformation?
   - Recommendation: "accept" or "reject"

**Critical**: If conditions are not perfectly preserved OR numbers don't match, this MUST be rejected.
