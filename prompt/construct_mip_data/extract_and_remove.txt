Analyze the following mathematical problem and generate removal variants.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Ground Truth Answer: {ground_truth}

Task:
1. Identify ALL conditions in the problem
2. For EACH condition, create a variant where that condition is removed
3. Rewrite the problem without that specific condition

Instructions:
- A condition is any piece of information that could help solve the problem
- Each variant should remove exactly ONE condition
- The rewritten problem should be natural and grammatically correct
- Keep all other conditions unchanged in each variant

Example:
Original Problem: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Conditions identified:
1. Jason bought 1 pencil
2. Mike bought 2 pencils

Variants to generate:

Variant 1 (remove condition 1):
- Removed: "Jason bought 1 pencil"
- Remaining: ["Mike bought 2 pencils"]
- Incomplete Question: "Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

Variant 2 (remove condition 2):
- Removed: "Mike bought 2 pencils"  
- Remaining: ["Jason bought 1 pencil"]
- Incomplete Question: "Jason bought 1 pencil. How many pencils did Jason buy?"

OUTPUT FORMAT:
CRITICAL: Output ONLY a raw JSON array. DO NOT use markdown code blocks, backticks, or any formatting.

Required format - output this EXACTLY:
[
  {{
    "removed_condition": "condition text",
    "remaining_conditions": ["other conditions"],
    "incomplete_question": "rewritten question without the removed condition"
  }},
  {{
    "removed_condition": "another condition",
    "remaining_conditions": ["remaining conditions"],
    "incomplete_question": "another rewritten question"
  }}
]

DO NOT output:
- ```json ... ``` (NO markdown blocks)
- Any explanatory text
- Any formatting other than raw JSON
