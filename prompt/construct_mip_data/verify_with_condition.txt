**Incomplete Problem (missing information)**:
{incomplete_question}

**Missing Condition (key information to complete the problem)**:
{removed_condition}

**Instructions**:
1. First, understand the incomplete problem
2. Then, integrate the missing condition into the problem to form a complete, solvable problem
3. Solve the complete problem step by step
4. Provide your reasoning in <think></think> tags
5. Provide ONLY the final answer in <answer></answer> tags

**CRITICAL**: The missing condition is essential to solve the problem. Make sure to use it to reconstruct the complete problem before solving.

**Example**:

Incomplete Problem: "Mike bought some pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Missing Condition: "Jason bought 1 pencil"

Complete Problem (after integration): "Jason bought 1 pencil. Mike bought some pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Answer: 1
