Identify entities in the problem and determine if pronoun ambiguity is applicable.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Conditions: {conditions}
Question: {question}

**Task**: Identify all entities and determine if we can create pronoun ambiguity.

**Entity Types to Identify**:

1. **People**: Names of individuals
   - Examples: Jason, Mike, Alice, Bob, the driver, the teacher

2. **Objects**: Specific items or things
   - Examples: triangle ABC, triangle DEF, the front tires, the rear tires

3. **Variables**: Mathematical variables
   - Examples: x, y, variable a, variable b

4. **Groups**: Collections or sets
   - Examples: Class A, Class B, the first team, the second team

**Pronoun Ambiguity Applicability**:

Pronoun ambiguity is applicable when ALL of these are true:
1. There are 2+ entities of the same type (2+ people, 2+ objects, 2+ variables)
2. The question refers to ONE specific entity
3. We can replace the specific reference with a pronoun that could refer to multiple entities
4. The entities are similar enough that a pronoun could naturally refer to any of them

**Examples**:

Example 1 - Applicable:
Problem: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
- Entities: Jason, Mike (both are people)
- Question references: Jason
- Can replace with: "he" (could mean Jason or Mike)
- Applicable: YES

Example 2 - Applicable:
Problem: "Triangle ABC has perimeter 12, Triangle DEF has perimeter 30. What is the perimeter of triangle ABC?"
- Entities: Triangle ABC, Triangle DEF
- Question references: Triangle ABC
- Can replace with: "it" or "this triangle" (could mean ABC or DEF)
- Applicable: YES

Example 3 - Not Applicable:
Problem: "A basket has 5 apples. How many apples are in the basket?"
- Entities: Only one basket
- No multiple similar entities to create confusion
- Applicable: NO

Example 4 - Not Applicable:
Problem: "Prove that x² + y² ≥ 2xy"
- This is a proof problem, not asking about a specific entity
- Applicable: NO

**Analysis**:

1. List all entities in the problem
2. Group entities by type (people, objects, variables, etc.)
3. Does the question reference a specific entity?
4. Can we replace it with a pronoun that creates ambiguity?
5. What pronouns would be appropriate?

**CRITICAL**: Output ONLY valid JSON, nothing else.

Output as JSON:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"name": "Jason", "type": "person"}},
    {{"name": "Mike", "type": "person"}}
  ],
  "pronoun_applicable": true,
  "reason": "why it is or isn't applicable",
  "question_references": "which entity the question asks about",
  "ambiguatable_entities": ["Jason", "Mike"],
  "suggested_pronouns": ["he", "they", "one of them"]
}}
