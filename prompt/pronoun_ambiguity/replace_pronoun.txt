Rewrite the problem by replacing a specific entity reference with an ambiguous pronoun.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Conditions: {conditions}
Original Question: {question}
Entities: {entities}
Suggested Pronouns: {suggested_pronouns}

**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. Keep ALL conditions EXACTLY as written - DO NOT change conditions
2. ONLY modify the question part to use an ambiguous pronoun
3. The pronoun must genuinely refer to 2+ possible entities
4. The ambiguity must make it impossible to determine which entity is meant

**Pronoun Replacement Examples**:

Example 1:
Original: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Rewritten: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did he buy?"
(Ambiguity: "he" could be Jason or Mike)

Example 2:
Original: "Triangle ABC has sides 3, 4, 5. Triangle DEF has sides 5, 12, 13. What is the perimeter of triangle ABC?"
Rewritten: "Triangle ABC has sides 3, 4, 5. Triangle DEF has sides 5, 12, 13. What is its perimeter?"
(Ambiguity: "its" could refer to ABC or DEF)

Example 3:
Original: "Alice has 5 apples, Bob has 3 apples. How many apples does Alice have?"
Rewritten: "Alice has 5 apples, Bob has 3 apples. How many apples does she have?"
(Ambiguity: "she" could be Alice, but if Bob were Betty, it could be either)

Example 4:
Original: "The front tires wear out after 25,000 km, the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km. When should the front tires be swapped?"
Rewritten: "The front tires wear out after 25,000 km, the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km. When should they be swapped?"
(Ambiguity: "they" could refer to front tires, rear tires, or all tires)
