Verify that the rewrite preserved all conditions and only changed the question.

Original Problem: {original_question}
Original Conditions: {original_conditions}
Original Question: {original_question_part}
Rewritten Problem: {rewritten_question}

**Verification Checklist**:

1. **Conditions Preservation** (CRITICAL - Weight 50%):
   - Are ALL conditions from the original problem present unchanged?
   - Are ALL numerical values exactly the same?
   - Are ALL entity names still present in conditions?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = perfect preservation, 0.0 = conditions changed)

2. **Question Changed to Pronoun** (Weight 30%):
   - Was a specific entity reference replaced with a pronoun?
   - Is the pronoun grammatically correct?
   - Does the question structure remain otherwise the same?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0

3. **Natural Language** (Weight 20%):
   - Is the rewritten problem grammatically correct?
   - Does the pronoun sound natural?
   - Is it realistic English?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0

4. **Overall Quality**:
   - Weighted average: (Conditions × 0.5) + (Question × 0.3) + (Natural × 0.2)
   - Recommendation: "accept" if overall >= 0.75, "reject" otherwise

**IMPORTANT**: 
- If conditions preservation < 1.0, overall score should be low
- If any numerical values changed, overall = 0.0
- Pronoun ambiguity itself is NOT a problem here - we only check if conditions are preserved

**Examples**:

Example 1 - Accept:
Original: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Rewritten: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did he buy?"
- Conditions: Perfect (1.0) - all numbers and names present
- Question: Good (0.9) - "Jason" → "he"
- Natural: Perfect (1.0) - sounds natural
- Overall: 0.97 → ACCEPT

Example 2 - Reject:
Original: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did Jason buy?"
Rewritten: "Two people bought pencils. How many did he buy?"
- Conditions: Failed (0.0) - names and numbers removed
- Overall: 0.0 → REJECT
