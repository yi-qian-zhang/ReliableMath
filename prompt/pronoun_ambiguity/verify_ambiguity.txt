Verify that the pronoun creates genuine ambiguity making the problem unsolvable.

Rewritten Problem: {rewritten_question}
Entities: {entities}
Original Answer: {ground_truth}

**Ambiguity Analysis**:

1. **Multiple Interpretations** (Weight 30%):
   - What pronoun was used?
   - Which entities could this pronoun refer to?
   - List all possible interpretations
   - For each interpretation, what would the answer be?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = clearly 2+ different interpretations with different answers)

2. **Genuine Ambiguity** (Weight 30%):
   - Is it truly impossible to determine which entity is meant from context?
   - Could context clues (recency, grammar, semantics) resolve the ambiguity?
   - Is the ambiguity fundamental or just superficial?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0 (1.0 = fundamentally ambiguous, no way to resolve)

3. **Naturalness of Ambiguity** (Weight 20%):
   - Does the pronoun usage sound natural?
   - Would a native speaker write this?
   - Is the ambiguity accidental-seeming (good) or forced (bad)?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0

4. **Deceptiveness** (Weight 20%):
   - Would someone initially try to answer before noticing the ambiguity?
   - Does it look like a solvable problem at first glance?
   - Score: 0.0-1.0

5. **Overall Assessment**:
   - Weighted average of above scores
   - Recommendation: "accept" if overall >= 0.70, "reject" otherwise

**IMPORTANT Guideline**:
- Having TOO MANY possible referents (3+) is GOOD, not bad
- "The pronoun could refer to A, B, or C" → HIGH score (very ambiguous)
- Context that DOESN'T resolve ambiguity → HIGH score
- If you're unsure which entity is meant → HIGH score (that's the goal!)

**Example of GOOD Ambiguity (High Score)**:

Problem: "Jason bought 1 pencil, Mike bought 2 pencils. How many pencils did he buy?"

Analysis:
- Pronoun "he" could refer to:
  * Jason → answer: 1
  * Mike → answer: 2
- No context clues to determine which person
- Multiple interpretations: YES (score: 0.95)
- Genuine ambiguity: YES (score: 0.90)
- Naturalness: Very natural (score: 0.85)
- Deceptiveness: Looks solvable (score: 0.80)
- Overall: 0.88 → ACCEPT

**Example of WEAK Ambiguity (Low Score)**:

Problem: "Jason is a teacher, Mike is a student. How many classes does he teach?"

Analysis:
- Pronoun "he" theoretically could refer to Jason or Mike
- BUT context strongly suggests Jason (only teachers teach classes)
- Multiple interpretations: Weak (score: 0.40)
- Genuine ambiguity: NO - context resolves it (score: 0.30)
- Overall: 0.35 → REJECT
