### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###:

Using the analysis above, produce a rewritten version of the original math question where the extracted condition "{extracted_condition}" is contradicted (i.e., replaced by a logically opposing statement). The rewritten question should be a coherent standalone math problem and explicitly show the contradicted condition.

Original question:
{original_math_question}
Original answer:
{original_answer}
