You are a good mathematical question rewriter.
Given a mathematical question ### Original Mathematical Question ###, the answer to the question is
### Original Answer ###, and ### Extracted Condition ### is a key mathematical condition extracted
from the question.

Your objective is to draw inspiration from the ### Original Mathematical Question ### and ###
Original Answer ### to rewrite a new math question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### with
the following two requirements.

1) The new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### need to add conditions that contradict to the condition ### Extracted Condition ### from the ### Original Mathematical Question ###. Maintain the rest of the conditions of ### Original
   Mathematical Question ### unchanged.
2) After adding conditions that contradict to the condition ### Extracted Condition ###, the new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### should be unsolvable.

### Original Mathematical Question ###: {original_math_question}

### Original Answer ###: {original_answer}

### Extracted Condition ###: {extracted_condition}

Think step by step to explain how you make the problem unsolvable after adding the contradicted condition. You only need to directly output your analysis after ### Analysis
###. Simplify your output as much as possible.

### Analysis ###:

Given your analysis in ### Analysis ### about how you make the problem unsolvable after adding the contradicted condition, you only need to directly output your new
mathematical question after ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###.

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###:
