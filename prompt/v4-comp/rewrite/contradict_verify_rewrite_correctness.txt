### Task ###:
You are given an ORIGINAL mathematical question and a REWRITTEN version with a contradicted condition.

Your task is to verify that the rewrite is CORRECT:
1. ONLY the specified condition was modified (contradicted)
2. All other conditions remain EXACTLY the same
3. The question structure and stem are preserved

### Input ###:
**Original Question**:
{original_question}

**Rewritten Question (with contradiction)**:
{rewritten_question}

**Contradicted Condition** (this ONE condition should be modified):
{contradicted_condition}

**Other Conditions** (should be preserved EXACTLY):
{other_conditions}

### Output Format ###:
Answer with ONLY one word:
- "True" if the rewrite is correct (only the specified condition was contradicted, everything else is identical)
- "False" if the rewrite is incorrect (multiple conditions changed, or question structure modified)

After your answer, you may provide a brief explanation.
