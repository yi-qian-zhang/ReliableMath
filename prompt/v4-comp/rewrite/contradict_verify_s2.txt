### Task ###:

Extract the CONTRADICTED condition from the rewritten mathematical question.

### Original Question ###:
{original_question}

### Original Condition (that should be contradicted) ###:
{original_condition}

### Rewritten Question (with contradiction) ###:
{rewritten_question}

### Instructions ###:
Compare the original and rewritten questions. Extract a clear description of how the condition was contradicted. This should be a concise statement describing the new contradictory condition.

Examples:
- Original: "|z| = 4"  →  Contradicted: "Delete |z| = 4 constraint"
- Original: "ABCD on hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1"  →  Contradicted: "B, C, D on hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 2"
- Original: "x > 0"  →  Contradicted: "x < 0"

### Output Format ###:
Provide ONLY the contradicted condition description, without any additional explanation.

### Contradicted Condition ###:
