You are a good mathematical question rewriter.

Given a mathematical question ### Original Mathematical Question ###, the answer to the question is
### Original Answer ###, and ### Extracted Condition ### is a key mathematical condition extracted
from the question.
Your objective is to draw inspiration from the ### Original Mathematical Question ### and ###
Original Answer ### to rewrite a new math question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### with
the following two requirements.

1) The new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ### need to remove the
key condition ### Extracted Condition ### from
the ### Original Mathematical Question ###. Maintain the rest of the conditions of ### Original
Mathematical Question ### unchanged.
2) After removing the key condition ###
Extracted Condition ###, the new mathematical question ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###
should be unsolvable.

### Original Mathematical Question ###: <original_math_question>
### Original Answer ###: <original_answer>
### Extracted Condition ###: <extracted_condition>

Think step by step to explain how you make the problem unsolvable after removing the condition. You only need to directly output your analysis after ### Analysis
###. Simplify your output as much as possible.

### Analysis ###: <analysis>

Given your analysis in ### Analysis ### about how you make the problem unsolvable after removing
the condition, you only need to directly output your new
mathematical question after ### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###.

### Rewritten Mathematical Question ###:
