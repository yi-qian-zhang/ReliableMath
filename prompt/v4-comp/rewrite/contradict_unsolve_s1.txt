### Task ###:

Analyze why the rewritten mathematical question (with contradicted condition) is UNSOLVABLE or has no unique solution.

### Original Question ###:
{original_question}

### Original Answer ###:
{original_answer}

### Rewritten Question (with contradiction) ###:
{rewritten_question}

### Instructions ###:
1. Analyze the logical structure of the rewritten question
2. Identify why the contradicted condition makes the problem unsolvable
3. Explain the mathematical reasoning clearly
4. Consider different types of unsolvability:
   - Logical contradiction (impossible conditions)
   - Unbounded solution (no unique answer)
   - Empty solution set (no solutions exist)
   - Insufficient constraints (multiple valid answers)

### Output Format ###:
Provide a detailed analysis (2-5 sentences) explaining why this problem cannot be solved uniquely.

### Analysis ###:
