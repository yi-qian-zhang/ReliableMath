### Task ###:
You are given a REWRITTEN mathematical question with a contradicted condition.

Your task is to verify that the rewritten question is VALID:
1. The question stem (what is being asked) is preserved
2. The problem is not trivially invalid (e.g., empty, nonsensical)
3. The problem is not asking for infinitely many solutions

### Input ###:
**Original Question**:
{original_question}

**Rewritten Question (with contradiction)**:
{rewritten_question}

**Contradicted Condition**:
{contradicted_condition}

### Output Format ###:
Answer with one of the following:
- "Valid" if the rewritten question is a valid mathematical problem (even if unsolvable due to contradiction)
- "Invalid" if the rewritten question is malformed, trivial, or asking for infinitely many solutions

After your answer, you may provide a brief explanation.
