This is because the eigenvalues of the zero matrix are both zero, indicating a center or non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\nSince the linearization is inconclusive, we need to consider higher-order terms or use other methods to determine stability. In this case, we can use Lyapunov's indirect method or analyze the system's behavior using a Lyapunov function. However, given the symmetry and the nature of the terms, we can infer that the origin is a stable equilibrium point.\n\nThe terms \\(y^3\\) and \\(x^3\\) dominate the behavior near the origin, and both are odd powers, which typically suggest that the system is stable near the origin. However, without a specific Lyapunov function or further analysis, we cannot definitively conclude asymptotic stability.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium point \\((0, 0)\\) is stable, but not asymptotically stable based on the information provided.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nThe equilibrium point \\((0, 0)\\) is stable but not asymptotically stable.\n</answer>"

Each person has 3 choices: feet on the floor (F), cross legs to the right (R), or cross legs to the left (L). Therefore, the total number of possible configurations is \\(3^6\\).\n\nNext, we need to count the number of configurations where no two adjacent people have conflicting leg positions. A conflict occurs with the pattern (R, L) between two adjacent people. We want to avoid this pattern.\n\nTo count the valid configurations, we can use a recursive approach. Let \\(a_n\\) be the number of valid configurations for \\(n\\) people. We can build the configurations for \\(n\\) people based on the configurations for \\(n-1\\) people:\n\n1. If the \\(n\\)-th person has their feet on the floor (F), there are no restrictions on the \\((n-1)\\)-th person, so there are \\(3 \\times a_{n-1}\\) configurations.\n2. If the \\(n\\)-th person crosses their legs to the right (R), the \\((n-1)\\)-th person can have their feet on the floor (F) or cross their legs to the right (R), but not to the left (L). Thus, there are \\(2 \\times a_{n-1}\\) configurations.\n3. If the \\(n\\)-th person crosses their legs to the left (L), the \\((n-1)\\)-th person can have their feet on the floor (F) or cross their legs to the left (L), but not to the right (R). Thus, there are \\(2 \\times a_{n-1}\\) configurations.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation is:\n\\[ a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-1} = 7a_{n-1} \\]\n\nThe base case is \\(a_1 = 3\\) because for one person, there are no restrictions, and they can choose any of the three positions.\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can calculate \\(a_6\\):\n- \\(a_1 = 3\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 7 \\times 3 = 21\\)\n- \\(a_3 = 7 \\times 21 = 147\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 7 \\times 147 = 1029\\)\n- \\(a_5 = 7 \\times 1029 = 7203\\)\n- \\(a_6 = 7 \\times 7203 = 50421\\)\n\nThe total number of configurations is \\(3^6 = 729\\).\n\nThe probability that no conflict occurs is:\n\\[ \\frac{a_6}{3^6} = \\frac{50421}{729} \\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 50421 and 729. Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n- \\(50421 \\div 729 \\approx 69.15\\), so \\(50421 = 69 \\times 729 + 240\\)\n- \\(729 \\div 240 \\approx 3.0375\\), so \\(729 = 3 \\times 240 + 9\\)\n- \\(240 \\div 9 \\approx 26.6667\\), so \\(240 = 26 \\times 9 + 6\\)\n- \\(9 \\div 6 \\approx 1.5\\), so \\(9 = 1 \\times 6 + 3\\)\n- \\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\), so \\(6 = 2 \\times 3 + 0\\)\n\nThe GCD is 3. Therefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\\[ \\frac{50421 \\div 3}{729 \\div 3} = \\frac{16807}{243} \\]\n\nSince 16807 and 243 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThus, \\(m = 16807\\) and \\(n = 243\\), and \\(m+n = 16807 + 243 = 17050\\).\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n17050\n</answer>"
