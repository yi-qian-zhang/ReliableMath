    "original_question": "The front tires of a car wear out after 25,000 km, and the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km. When should the tires be swapped so that they wear out at the same time?",
    "original_answer": "9375",
    "removed_condition": "The rear tires wear out after 15,000 km.",
    "unsolvable_question": "The front tires of a car wear out after 25,000 km. When should the tires be swapped so that they wear out at the same time?",
    "analysis": "1. **What role does this condition play in solving the problem?**  \n   The condition that the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km provides the wear rate of the rear tires. This is critical for determining how quickly the rear tires degrade relative to the front tires. The problem involves balancing the wear rates of the front and rear tires by swapping them at the appropriate time so that all four tires wear out simultaneously. Without knowing the wear rate of the rear tires, it is impossible to calculate when the swap should occur.\n\n2. **What critical information would be missing without this condition?**  \n   Without the condition that the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km, the wear rate of the rear tires would be unknown. This missing information would prevent us from establishing the relationship between the wear rates of the front and rear tires, which is essential for determining the optimal swap point.\n\n3. **Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?**  \n   The problem becomes unsolvable because the wear rates of the front and rear tires are the foundation of the mathematical model used to solve the problem. Specifically, the solution requires setting up equations that equate the total wear of the front and rear tires over time, factoring in the swap. Without the wear rate of the rear tires (15,000 km), there is no way to construct these equations, leaving the problem indeterminate.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe condition that the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km is essential for solving the problem. Removing this condition eliminates the ability to calculate the wear rate of the rear tires, making it impossible to determine the optimal swap point and rendering the problem unsolvable."

    "analysis": "1. **What role does this condition play in solving the problem?**\n   The condition that the tires should wear out at the same time is the key constraint that determines the swapping strategy. It ensures that the wear on the front and rear tires is balanced over time, leading to simultaneous wear-out. Without this condition, there would be no specific goal to optimize the swapping schedule.\n\n2. **What critical information would be missing without this condition?**\n   Without the condition, there would be no clear criterion for when to swap the tires. The problem would lack a defined objective, such as minimizing wear imbalance or ensuring simultaneous wear-out. This would leave the swapping schedule arbitrary, as there would be no way to evaluate whether one schedule is better than another.\n\n3. **Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?**\n   The problem would become unsolvable because it would no longer have a well-defined goal. The condition provides the necessary framework to calculate the optimal swapping point (9375 km in the original problem). Without it, there is no mathematical basis for determining when to swap the tires, as the problem lacks a clear endpoint or optimization criterion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe condition that the tires should wear out at the same time is essential for defining the problem's objective and making it solvable. Removing this condition eliminates the goal, leaving the problem undefined and unsolvable."

    "analysis": "### Analysis of the Problem and the Condition\n\n#### **1. What role does this condition play in solving the problem?**\nThe condition specifies the lengths of all six edges of the tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\): \\(AB = c\\), \\(BC = a\\), \\(CA = b\\), \\(DA = a_1\\), \\(DB = b_1\\), and \\(DC = c_1\\). These edge lengths are essential for determining the geometric properties of the tetrahedron, such as its shape, size, and spatial configuration. Specifically:\n- The edge lengths allow us to compute distances between vertices, which are critical for deriving the formula for the median length \\(h\\) from vertex \\(D\\).\n- The condition ensures that the tetrahedron is uniquely defined, avoiding ambiguity in its geometry.\n\n#### **2. What critical information would be missing without this condition?**\nWithout the explicit specification of the edge lengths:\n- **Geometric ambiguity**: The tetrahedron would not be uniquely defined. There could be infinitely many tetrahedra with different edge lengths, making it impossible to compute \\(h\\) or verify the formula.\n- **Median computation**: The formula for \\(h^2\\) depends on the edge lengths \\(a_1, b_1, c_1\\) (connecting vertex \\(D\\) to the other vertices) and \\(a, b, c\\) (forming the triangular base \\(ABC\\)). Without these values, the derivation of \\(h^2\\) would lack the necessary inputs.\n- **Symmetry and balance**: The relationship between the edge lengths ensures that the tetrahedron satisfies certain geometric constraints, such as the triangle inequality for each face. Removing the condition would make it impossible to verify whether the tetrahedron is valid.\n\n#### **3. Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?**\nThe problem would become unsolvable for the following reasons:\n- **Loss of structure**: The formula for \\(h^2\\) relies on the specific arrangement of edge lengths. Without these values, the derivation of the median length \\(h\\) would lack a foundation.\n- **Undefined variables**: The edge lengths \\(a, b, c, a_1, b_1, c_1\\) are fundamental to the formula. Removing the condition would leave these variables undefined, making the formula meaningless.\n- **No geometric context**: The tetrahedron's geometry is entirely determined by its edge lengths. Without them, there is no way to compute distances, areas, or medians.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe condition specifying the edge lengths of the tetrahedron is **critical** to solving the problem. It provides the necessary geometric context and numerical inputs for deriving the formula for the median length \\(h\\). Without this condition, the problem becomes unsolvable due to the loss of structure, undefined variables, and geometric ambiguity."

    "analysis": "#### 1. **What role does this condition play in solving the problem?**\n\nThe condition that \"$h$ is the length of the median line from vertex $D$\" is crucial because it defines the geometric and mathematical context of the problem. Specifically:\n- The median line from vertex $D$ is the line segment connecting $D$ to the centroid of the triangle $ABC$ (the face opposite $D$).\n- The length of the median, $h$, depends on the relative positions of $D$ and the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$, which in turn depends on the edge lengths of the tetrahedron.\n- This condition allows us to compute $h$ using the geometric properties of the tetrahedron, such as the distances between vertices and the centroid formula for a triangle.\n\nWithout this condition, the variable $h$ would lack a clear geometric interpretation, making it impossible to derive the given formula.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **What critical information would be missing without this condition?**\n\nIf the condition that \"$h$ is the length of the median line from vertex $D$\" were removed, the following critical information would be missing:\n- **Definition of $h$**: The problem would no longer specify what $h$ represents. Without knowing that $h$ is the length of the median, we cannot relate $h$ to the edge lengths of the tetrahedron.\n- **Geometric context**: The relationship between $D$ and the triangle $ABC$ (via the centroid) would be undefined. This relationship is essential for deriving the formula for $h^2$.\n- **Centroid properties**: The formula for $h^2$ relies on the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$, which divides each median in a $2:1$ ratio. Without this condition, the derivation of $h^2$ would lack a foundation.\n\nIn short, the problem would lose the connection between $h$ and the geometry of the tetrahedron.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?**\n\nThe problem would become unsolvable without the condition because:\n- The formula for $h^2$ explicitly depends on the geometric interpretation of $h$ as the length of the median. Without this interpretation, there is no way to justify the formula or derive it.\n- The derivation of $h^2$ involves using the centroid formula for $\\triangle ABC$ and the distances between $D$ and the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$. Without the condition, these relationships cannot be established.\n- The formula for $h^2$ includes terms like $\\frac{1}{3}(a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2)$ and $\\frac{1}{9}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$, which arise from the specific geometry of the median. Without the condition, these terms would lack meaning or justification.\n\nIn essence, the problem relies entirely on the geometric definition of $h$ as the length of the median. Removing this condition eliminates the foundation of the problem, making it impossible to solve or interpret the formula.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe condition that \"$h$ is the length of the median line from vertex $D$\" is indispensable for solving the problem. It provides the geometric context, defines $h$, and establishes the relationships needed to derive the formula. Without this condition, the problem becomes unsolvable because $h$ would lack a clear definition, and the formula would lose its geometric justification."
