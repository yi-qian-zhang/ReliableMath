    "original_question": "The front tires of a car wear out after 25,000 km, and the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km. When should the tires be swapped so that they wear out at the same time?",
    "original_answer": "9375",
    "removed_condition": "The rear tires wear out after 15,000 km.",
    "unsolvable_question": "The front tires of a car wear out after 25,000 km. When should the tires be swapped so that they wear out at the same time?",
    "analysis": "1. **What role does this condition play in solving the problem?**\n   The condition that the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km provides the wear rate of the rear tires. This is critical for determining how quickly the rear tires degrade relative to the front tires. The problem involves balancing the wear rates of the front and rear tires by swapping them at the right time so that all four tires wear out simultaneously. Without knowing the wear rate of the rear tires, it is impossible to calculate the point at which the wear on both sets of tires will equalize.\n\n2. **What critical information would be missing without this condition?**\n   Without the condition that the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km, the wear rate of the rear tires would be unknown. This means we would lack the necessary data to compare the wear rates of the front and rear tires. Specifically, we would not know how much distance the rear tires can travel before they wear out, which is essential for determining the timing of the tire swap.\n\n3. **Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?**\n   The problem becomes unsolvable because the solution relies on the relationship between the wear rates of the front and rear tires. If the wear rate of the rear tires is unknown, we cannot set up the equations needed to calculate the optimal swap point. The problem requires both wear rates to determine when the tires should be swapped to ensure they wear out simultaneously. Without the wear rate of the rear tires, there is insufficient information to solve the problem.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe condition that the rear tires wear out after 15,000 km is essential because it provides the wear rate of the rear tires. Without this condition, the problem lacks critical information, making it impossible to calculate the optimal tire swap point."

    "analysis": "1. **What role does this condition play in solving the problem?**\n   The condition that the tires should wear out at the same time is the key constraint that determines the swapping strategy. It ensures that the wear on the front and rear tires is balanced over time, leading to simultaneous wear-out. Without this condition, there would be no specific goal to optimize the swapping schedule.\n\n2. **What critical information would be missing without this condition?**\n   Without the condition, there is no clear criterion for when to swap the tires. The problem would lack a defined objective, such as minimizing wear imbalance or achieving simultaneous wear-out. This would leave the swapping schedule arbitrary, as there would be no way to evaluate whether one schedule is better than another.\n\n3. **Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?**\n   The problem becomes unsolvable because the absence of the condition removes the objective function or goal. Without a clear goal (e.g., simultaneous wear-out), there is no way to determine the optimal swapping point. The problem would devolve into an open-ended question with infinitely many possible answers, none of which could be justified as \"correct\" without additional constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe condition that the tires should wear out at the same time is essential for defining the problem's objective and determining the swapping strategy. Without it, the problem lacks a clear goal, making it unsolvable in a meaningful way."

    "analysis": "#### **Step 1: What role does this condition play in solving the problem?**\nThe condition \"the divisor must be the smallest possible\" is crucial because it defines the objective of the problem. Without this condition, there would be infinitely many divisors that satisfy the quotient being 2.5 when the largest three-digit number (999) is divided by them. The condition narrows the solution space to a single, unique divisor—the smallest one.\n\n#### **Step 2: What critical information would be missing without this condition?**\nWithout the condition of finding the smallest divisor, the problem lacks a clear optimization criterion. While the quotient (2.5) provides a relationship between the dividend (999) and the divisor, it does not specify which divisor to choose among the infinitely many possibilities. The absence of this condition would leave the problem open-ended, as there would be no way to determine which divisor is \"correct\" or preferred.\n\n#### **Step 3: Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?**\nThe problem becomes unsolvable in the sense that it no longer has a unique solution. Without the condition to find the smallest divisor, the problem would allow any divisor that satisfies the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{999}{d} = 2.5 \\quad \\text{(rounded to one decimal place)}.\n\\]\n\nThis equation can be satisfied by multiple divisors, as rounding introduces ambiguity. For example, divisors such as 399.6, 399.5, and others could all produce a quotient of 2.5 when rounded. Without the \"smallest divisor\" condition, there is no way to determine which divisor to select, making the problem ill-defined.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe condition \"the divisor must be the smallest possible\" is essential for the problem to have a unique and well-defined solution. It provides the optimization criterion that eliminates ambiguity and ensures the problem is solvable. Without this condition, the problem becomes open-ended and lacks a clear resolution."

Specifically:\n   - The hexagon is symmetric under rotations of \\( 120^\\circ \\) and \\( 240^\\circ \\) about \\( P \\), meaning that the vertices of the hexagon are evenly spaced around \\( P \\) in a cyclic order.\n   - This symmetry ensures that the hexagon can be divided into six congruent equilateral triangles, each sharing a vertex at \\( P \\). This simplifies the problem significantly, as the geometry of the hexagon becomes highly regular and predictable.\n\nThe symmetry also ensures that the side lengths and angles of the hexagon are consistent, and the relationships between the vertices (e.g., \\( G, H, X \\)) can be determined using symmetry arguments.\n\n#### 2. **What critical information would be missing without this condition?**\nWithout the \\( 120^\\circ \\)-rotational symmetry condition:\n   - The hexagon would no longer be guaranteed to have a regular structure.

Why the problem becomes unsolvable without this information:**\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) between \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{b}\\) is determined by solving the equation:\n\\[\n|\\overrightarrow{a} + \\overrightarrow{b}|^2 = |\\overrightarrow{a}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{b}|^2 + 2|\\overrightarrow{a}||\\overrightarrow{b}|\\cos\\theta.\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 2(2)(1)\\cos\\theta.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n3 = 4 + 1 + 4\\cos\\theta \\quad \\implies \\quad 4\\cos\\theta = -2 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\cos\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nFrom \\(\\cos\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the angle \\(\\theta\\) is determined as:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}.\n\\]\nWithout the condition \\( |\\overrightarrow{a} + \\overrightarrow{b}| = \\sqrt{3} \\), this equation cannot be set up, and \\(\\theta\\) cannot be uniquely determined. The problem becomes unsolvable because there is no way to constrain the relative orientation of \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{b}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe condition \\( |\\overrightarrow{a} + \\overrightarrow{b}| = \\sqrt{3} \\) is essential for solving the problem because it provides the necessary constraint to determine the angle \\(\\theta\\) between \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{b}\\). Without this condition, the problem becomes underdetermined, and the angle cannot be uniquely calculated."

Let us analyze step by step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: What role does this condition play in solving the problem?\n\nThe system of differential equations provides the **dynamics** of the problem. Specifically:\n- It describes how the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) evolve over time (\\(t\\)).\n- The equilibrium point \\((x, y) = (0, 0)\\) is determined by setting \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\), which is satisfied at \\((x, y) = (0, 0)\\) for this system.\n- The stability of the equilibrium point is analyzed by studying the behavior of solutions near \\((x, y) = (0, 0)\\), which depends on the specific functional forms of \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\).\n\nWithout the system of differential equations, there would be no mathematical framework to analyze the stability of the equilibrium point.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What critical information would be missing without this condition?\n\nIf the system of differential equations is removed, the following critical information would be missing:\n1. **The functional forms of \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\):**\n   - These functions determine the nonlinear terms (\\(y^3, x^5, x^3, y^5\\)) that govern the dynamics of the system.\n   - The specific nonlinearities are crucial for determining the stability of the equilibrium point.\n\n2. **The relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):**\n   - The coupling between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the equations (e.g., \\(y^3\\) in \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) and \\(x^3\\) in \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\)) affects the stability analysis.\n   - Without these relationships, it would be impossible to determine how perturbations in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) interact and evolve over time.\n\n3. **The equilibrium point itself:**\n   - The equilibrium point \\((x, y) = (0, 0)\\) is derived from the system of equations. Without the equations, the equilibrium point cannot be identified.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Why would the problem become unsolvable without this information?\n\nThe problem would become unsolvable for the following reasons:\n1. **No dynamics to analyze:**\n   - Stability analysis requires the equations of motion to determine how small perturbations around the equilibrium point evolve over time. Without the system of differential equations, there are no dynamics to analyze.\n\n2. **No equilibrium point:**\n   - The equilibrium point \\((x, y) = (0, 0)\\) is defined as the point where \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\). Without the equations, the equilibrium point cannot be identified, and stability analysis becomes meaningless.\n\n3. **No linearization or higher-order analysis:**\n   - Stability analysis often involves linearizing the system around the equilibrium point or analyzing higher-order terms. This process depends entirely on the functional forms of \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\). Without the equations, these analyses cannot be performed.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe system of differential equations is the **core condition** of the problem. It defines the dynamics, the equilibrium point, and the relationships between the variables. Without this condition:\n- The problem becomes undefined, as there are no equations to analyze.\n- Critical information about the system's behavior near the equilibrium point is missing.\n- Stability analysis cannot be performed, rendering the problem unsolvable."
