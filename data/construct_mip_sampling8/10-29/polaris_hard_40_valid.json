So perhaps the problem defines a weird subset as a subset that contains exactly one of each pair (x, y) where x + y is a power of two, and for elements not in any such pair, they can be included or excluded freely. Therefore, the empty set is considered weird because it contains exactly zero elements from the pairs and the isolated elements are free to be included or excluded, but in the case of the empty set, they are all excluded. So, in that sense, the empty set is a weird subset.",
