The question is about finding the smallest divisor of the largest three-digit number when divided by some integer, such that the quotient rounded to one decimal place is 2.5. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem in my own words. We have the largest three-digit number, which is obviously 999. This number is divided by an integer, let's call it x. When we do this division, 999 ÷ x, the result is a quotient that, when rounded to one decimal place, equals 2.5. Our task is to find the smallest divisor (which I think refers to the smallest possible x that satisfies this condition) and then determine what that x is. Wait, actually, the problem says \"will have the smallest divisor as:\" So maybe once we find that x, the answer is x itself? Or is there another step? Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The largest three-digit number divided by an integer, with the quotient ro"

Here, plugging x=0 and y=0 into the equations gives 0 on both sides, so that checks out. Now, to analyze stability, one common method is to linearize the system around the equilibrium point and check the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. If all eigenvalues have negative real parts, the equilibrium is asymptotically stable. If any eigenvalue has a positive real part, it's unstable. If eigenvalues have zero real parts, then the linearization doesn't tell us, and we need another method.\n\nSo let me compute the Jacobian matrix for this system.

Generally, a line can be parameterized as r = r₀ + t*v, where r₀ is a point on the line and v is the direction vector of the line. \n\nFirst, let me find the direction vector of the given line. The line is in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope. The slope here is 5/3. In terms of direction vectors, a line with slope m can be represented with a direction vector where the rise is m and the run is 1. So, if the slope is 5/3, then a direction vector would be (3, 5), since for every 3 units in x, y increases by 5. Alternatively, any scalar multiple of this vector would also work as a direction vector. So direction vectors like (3,5), (-3,-5), (6,10), etc., are all valid because they are scalar multiples of the original direction vector.\n\nNow, for each option, I need to check two th"

Our job is to find how many different 8-digit numbers could have resulted in 202020 when the broken 1 key is considered.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. When Sasha types a number, any '1's she intended to type don't appear. So, for example, if she tried to type 1231234, the output is 23234.

Let me recall that AN is the angle bisector of angle BAC, so it splits angle A into two equal parts. BH is the altitude from B to AC, meaning it meets AC at a right angle. The third line is perpendicular to AB and passes through its midpoint. Let me note that the line perpendicular to AB through its midpoint is actually the perpendicular bisector of AB. In a triangle, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet at the circumcenter, but here we have only one perpendicular bisector involved, intersecting with the angle bisector and altitude.\n\nSince all three lines meet at a single point, let's denote this common point as P."

The second part is to find how far the meeting point is from the midpoint between A and B.\n\nHmm, right. For the first part, I think when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So the total distance between them should be covered by both of them together. So maybe I can calculate the combined distance they cover in 10 minutes and that should be the total distance between A and B.\n\nLet me check. If Person A is moving at 65 m/min and Person B at 55 m/min towards each other, then their closing speed is 65 + 55 = 120 meters per minute. So in 10 minutes, they would cover 120 * 10 = 1200 meters.

The other digits can include 0, as long as they are not repeated.\n\nBut the main condition here is about the unit digit (which is the sixth digit from the left, right?) being less than the ten's digit (which is the fifth digit from the left).

Hmm, first, I should probably start by understanding the volumes involved here. \n\nSo, the original cube has a side length of 1 meter. Wait, 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, right? Because 1 meter is 100 cm. So, the volume of the original cube would be side length cubed. Let me write that down. The volume of the big cube is (1 m)^3. But since I need to work with centimeters, maybe I should convert that to centimeters first. \n\nSo, converting 1 meter to centimeters: 1 m = 100 cm. Therefore, the volume is (100 cm)^3. Let me calculate that. 100 cubed is 1,000,000. So, the volume is 1,000,000 cubic centimeters. \n\nNow, each small cube has a side length of 1 cm.

When θ is π/3, cosθ is cos(π/3) which is 0.5.

The maximum will be at one of the endpoints.\n\nFirst, let's find the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with absolute value inequalities, one common method is to square both sides to eliminate the absolute values. But I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. However, since both sides are absolute values (which are non-negative), squaring should preserve the inequality direction. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I square both sides, the inequality becomes:\n\n(|x² - 4x - 39601|)² ≥ (|x² + 4x - 39601|)²\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(x² - 4x - 39601)² ≥ (x² + 4x - 39601)²\n\nNow, expanding both sides might help. Let me denote A = x² - 39601 for simplicity. Then the left side becomes (A - 4x)² and the right side is (A + 4x)².
