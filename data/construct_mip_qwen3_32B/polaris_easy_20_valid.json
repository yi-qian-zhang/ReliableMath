    "answer_with_condition": "tags. Wait, looking back at the example, the user provided an example where the answer was just the final answer. However, the problem here has three parts. Wait, the original problem has three parts. The user instructions say to solve the complete problem step by step and provide the final answer in <answer> tags. But the example only had one answer. Maybe the user expects all answers in the <answer> tags? Or maybe the problem is structured such that the final answer is only for the third part? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe original problem says:\n\nWhen θ = π/3, find the max and min... If f(x) is monotonous... find range of θ. If sinα and cosα are roots... find value of...\n\nSo three separate questions. The user instructions say to solve the complete problem step by step and provide the final answer in <answer> tags. The example had one answer, but maybe here we need to provide all three answers in the <answer> tags. However, the example's answer was just the final answer of the complete problem. But in this case, the problem has three parts. The user might expect all three answers. However, the original problem's missing condition is only for the first part. Wait, the missing condition is x ∈ [ -√3/2, 1/2 ] which is only for the first part. The second part about monotonicity might not require the interval? Wait, no, the second part says \"If f(x) is a monotonous function...\" but the domain of x is not specified. Wait, in the original problem statement, the missing condition is given as x ∈ [ -√3/2, 1/2 ] which was added to the first part. But the second part about monotonicity: does it require the same interval? The original problem says \"If f(x) is a monotonous function and θ ∈ [0, 2π), find the range of θ.\" The problem doesn't specify an interval for x here. But in the first part, the interval was given. However, in the second part, since the first part's interval is part of the problem now, maybe the second part also refers to the same interval? Because otherwise, if x is over all real numbers, a quadratic function can't be monotonous. Since quadratics are parabolas, they are not monotonic over the entire real line. Therefore, the second part must refer to the same interval x ∈ [ -√3/2, 1/2 ] as given in the missing condition. Therefore, the analysis for the second part is correct as done earlier.\n\nTherefore, the three answers are:\n\n1. When θ=π/3, max is 7/4 + √3/2, min is 3/4.\n\n2. θ ∈ [0, π/3] ∪ [5π/6, 7π/6] ∪ [5π/3, 2π).\n\n3. (16 + 4√11)/5.\n\nBut the user instructions say to provide the final answer in <answer> tags. However, the example had only one answer. Maybe the problem expects all three answers? Or maybe the third part is the only one required? The original problem statement says \"find the value of...\", so maybe the third part is the final answer? But the user instructions say to solve the complete problem step by step and provide the final answer. It's ambiguous. However, looking back at the example, the complete problem was a single question, and the answer was given. Here, the problem has three parts. The user might expect all three answers. However, the way the problem is written, the three parts are separate. But the user instructions might expect all answers. However, since the user hasn't specified, but the example only had one answer, perhaps the assistant is supposed to provide all answers in the <answer> tags. But how to format that? Maybe separate them with commas or something. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects only the third part's answer? But the original problem says \"find the maximum and minimum...\", \"find the range...\", \"find the value...\". All three are required. However, the user instructions say \"provide the final answer in <answer> tags\". Maybe the final answer refers to the last part. But to be safe, perhaps I should check the problem again.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided an incomplete problem and a missing condition. The incomplete problem has three parts. The missing condition is for the first part. The user instructions say to integrate the missing condition, solve the complete problem step by step, and provide the final answer in <answer> tags. The example shows that the answer is the final answer of the complete problem. In the example, the complete problem was a single question, so the answer was one. Here, the complete problem has three parts. Therefore, the final answer would be all three answers. However, the way the example is structured, the assistant is supposed to write the complete problem, solve it step by step, and then put the final answer in <answer> tags. Since there are three parts, perhaps the assistant should list all three answers inside the <answer> tags. However, the example only had one answer. Maybe the user expects all three answers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem says:\n\nWhen θ = π/3, find the maximum and minimum values of f(x). If f(x) is a monotonous function and θ ∈ [0, 2π), find the range of θ. If sinα and cosα are the two real roots... find the value...\n\nSo three separate questions. Therefore, the final answers are three. But how to format them? The example shows that the answer is just the final answer of the problem. But since this problem has three parts, maybe the assistant is supposed to answer all three. However, the user instructions might expect the assistant to provide all answers. Given that, I'll proceed to write all three answers in the <answer> tags, separated appropriately.\n\nBut let me check if the third part's answer is correct. Let me recompute:\n\nWe had 1/(sinα cosα) = 4/(4 - √11) = [4*(4 + √11)] / [ (4 - √11)(4 + √11) ] = [16 + 4√11]/[16 - 11] = [16 + 4√11]/5. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the three answers are:\n\n1. Maximum value: 7/4 + √3/2, minimum value: 3/4.\n\n2. θ ∈ [0, π/3] ∪ [5π/6, 7π/6] ∪ [5π/3, 2π).\n\n3. (16 + 4√11)/5.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answers in a specific format. For example, the first part has two answers, max and min. The second part is a range. The third part is a value. Since the user instructions say to provide the final answer in <answer> tags, but there are three parts, perhaps the assistant should list all three answers inside the <answer> tags. However, the example only had one answer. Maybe the user expects only the third part's answer? But the problem says \"solve the complete problem step by step\" which includes all three parts. Given the ambiguity, but following the example's structure, perhaps the assistant should provide all answers. However, since the example's answer was just the final answer of the complete problem, which in this case would be the third part. But I'm not sure. To be safe, I'll provide all three answers in the <answer> tags, separated by commas or as a list.\n\nBut the user might have intended only the third part as the final answer. However, the problem statement includes three questions. Given that, I think the correct approach is to provide all three answers. However, since the user's example only had one answer, maybe they expect only the third part. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Given that, I'll proceed to write all three answers in the <answer> tags, formatted as per the example.\n\nBut the example's answer was in a box. However, the user instructions here say to provide the final answer in <answer> tags. Given that, I'll write all three answers inside the <answer> tags, separated by semicolons or commas.\n\nBut let me check the problem again. The original problem says:\n\nWhen θ = π/3, find the maximum and minimum values of f(x). If f(x) is a monotonous function and θ ∈ [0, 2π), find the range of θ. If sinα and cosα are the two real roots of the equation f(x) = 1/4 + cosθ, find the value of...\n\nSo three separate questions. Therefore, the final answers are three. Hence, I'll present them all.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFirst part: Maximum value is 7/4 + √3/2, minimum value is 3/4; second part: θ ∈ [0, π/3] ∪ [5π/6, 7π/6] ∪ [5π/3, 2π); third part: (16 + 4√11)/5.\n\nBut the user might expect boxed answers. However, the example didn't use boxes. Given the instructions, I'll follow the example and put the final answers in <answer> tags. Since there are three parts, I'll list them as three answers. However, the example only had one. Maybe the user expects only the third part. Given the ambiguity, but since the problem has three parts, I'll proceed to include all three.\n\nBut looking back at the user's instructions:\n\n\"Provide the final answer in <answer> tags\"\n\nThe example's answer was just the final answer of the complete problem. In this case, the complete problem has three parts. The final part is the third one. Therefore, maybe the user expects only the third part's answer. However, the problem says \"solve the complete problem step by step\", which implies all parts. Given the uncertainty, but to align with the example, I'll provide the final answer of the last part, which is the third part.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (16 + 4√11)/5.\n\nBut to confirm, let me check if the third part is indeed the last part. Yes, the problem lists three questions, and the third is the last. Therefore, following the example, the final answer is the answer to the last part. Hence, I'll put that in the <answer> tags.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<answer>\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{16 + 4\\sqrt{11}}{5}}",
