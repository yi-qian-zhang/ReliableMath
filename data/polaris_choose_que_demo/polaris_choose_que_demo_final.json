                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem about parameterizing a line using vectors, and I need to figure out which of the options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what a parameterization of a line is.\n\nFrom what I remember, a line in vector form can be written as **r** = **r₀** + t**v**, where **r₀** is a point on the line, **v** is the direction vector, and t is a scalar parameter. So each of these options is in the form of a point plus a scalar multiplied by a vector, which is exactly that. But I think I need to check whether the given point is on the line and whether the direction vector is correct.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. The problem just says \"a line is to be parameterized using vectors.\" It doesn't specify any particular line or condition. Maybe I misread the problem. It just asks which of the parameterizations are valid, regardless of the specific line. Hmm, but wait, without a specific line, how can we validate the parameterization? Or is the question about whether each given parameterization correctly represents some line?\n\nWait, perhaps each parameterization is for a different line, and I need to confirm that each one is a correct parameterization of its respective line. So, to be a valid parameterization, it must satisfy that when t varies over all real numbers, it traces out a straight line.\n\nBut I think the key here is that any such parameterization is valid as long as the point **r₀** is on the line and the direction vector **v** is the direction of the line. But since the lines themselves aren't given, maybe the only requirement is that the parameterization is correctly formed.\n\nWait, is that so? Or maybe in this context, each option is a parameterization, and regardless of what line it represents, as long as it's a vector equation of a line, then it's valid. But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me see. Maybe the problem is more about whether each given parameterization is valid in terms of the format, regardless of the specific line's identity. So maybe I need to check whether each is correctly expressed as a point plus scalar times direction vector.\n\nLooking back at each option:\n\n(A) is given as (4, 1) + t*(-3, -5). So that seems fine. It's a point plus t times a direction vector. So that's a valid parameterization.\n\n(B) is (17, 5) + t*(6, 10). Similarly, that's a point plus t times a direction vector. So that should be valid as well.\n\n(C) is (2, -7/3) + t*(3/5, 1). Again, same structure. A point and a direction vector. So that's valid.\n\n(D) is (14/5, -1) + t*(1, 3/5). Hmm, same thing again. Point plus t times vector. So this is valid.\n\n(E) is (0, -17/3) + t*(15, -25). Okay, so that's the same format as the others, so that's a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, is that all? So is every option correct? That seems too easy. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about whether each parameterization corresponds to the same specific line? But the problem doesn't specify any particular line, just asks which options are valid parameterizations. Since all of them are in the form of point plus t times direction vector, which is the standard parameterization of a line, then all of them are valid.\n\nBut then why am I overcomplicating this? Maybe some of them have an issue with the direction vector or the point not lying on the line. But since no specific line is given, each parameterization is valid for some line.\n\nWait, but if the question is just whether it's correctly parameterized as a line, regardless of which line it is, then all of them are correct. So perhaps all options are correct, i.e., A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is different. Maybe the initial point must lie on the given line? Wait, the problem statement doesn't mention a specific line. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations? (A)... (B)... (C)... (D)... (E)...\" So, it's about parameterizing a line, meaning for any line, or for a particular line. But the line isn't specified. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, maybe each option is meant to represent a line, but as they are given, maybe the point is on the line, and direction vector is correct? But without knowing the specific line, I can't check if the point is on it. So, perhaps we can assume that as long as it's in vector form, it's a valid parameterization, regardless.\n\nWait, maybe that's the case. So, all of them are valid because they are correctly structured as a point plus t times a direction vector. So, the answer would be all of A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe each option's direction vector is correct relative to some line.\n\nWait, but without a specific line, I think each of these is a valid parameterization of some line, so all of them are correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the problem is part of a multiple-choice question, and perhaps it's designed to make you think in terms of checking direction vectors for parallelism or something else. Hmm, no, I don't think so. Because without a specific line, you can't determine if the direction vectors are appropriate. Alternatively, if the line was, say, passing through the origin, we could check whether the direction vector is correct. But since it's not given, I can't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another language, or I misread it. Wait, no, it's given as \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors.\"\n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. It's possible that the problem is testing whether each parameterization is correct in representing a line in the plane, so that all of the given forms are acceptable, because they all have the form **r** = **r₀** + t**v**, where **r₀** is a fixed point and **v** is a fixed direction vector. Since all these options have that structure, they are all correct.\n\nTherefore, all options A through E are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut, let me think if this makes sense. For example, sometimes in problems, you have to ensure that the direction vector is non-zero, but these direction vectors are all non-zero because they have components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of these might have been incorrectly scaled, but unless the question is about being a specific scalar multiple, but in parameterization, the direction vector can be any non-zero scalar multiple, but in these options, the direction vectors are given as they are.\n\nWait, so maybe each one is just a different way of parameterizing different lines, but all correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if each is written correctly as a vector equation.\n\nLooking at option (C): the point is (2, -7/3). The direction vector is (3/5, 1). So, let's see, if you write this out, the parametric equations would be x = 2 + (3/5)t and y = -7/3 + t. So, that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, option (E): x = 0 + 15t and y = -17/3 -25t. Again, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe to test whether the direction vector is consistent with something else, but again, since there's no specific line, it's just a matter of being in the right form.\n\nWait, maybe someone could interpret that you have to provide a specific line, but the problem only says \"a line is to be parameterized\". So, the line isn't given, and we're just being asked about the validity of the parameterization.\n\nHence, in that case, all parameterizations are valid because they are each of the form point plus scalar times vector, which is the standard parameterization.\n\nTherefore, all options A through E are valid. So, I think I should choose all of them.\n\nWait, but let me just verify once more.\n\nFor example, take option (C). Is there any issue with the components? Let me compute the direction vector: (3/5, 1). Since it's a direction vector, the components can be any real numbers except both zero. 3/5 is 0.6 and 1 is non-zero. So, that's a valid direction vector.\n\nOption (E): direction vector is (15, -25). Again, non-zero components, so that's fine.\n\nSo, as long as the given equations are in the form of a point plus scalar times direction vector, they are parameterizations of some line. So, since all of A to E fit that, all of them are correct.\n\nHence, the answer should include all letters: A, B, C, D, E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of a line, we recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form is expressed as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\), where \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) is the direction vector.\n\nEach option provided is checked to ensure it is in the correct form:\n\n- **Option (A)**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n  - This is a point plus a scalar times a direction vector.

Valid.\n\nSince all options are in the correct form, they are all valid parameterizations of some line.\n\n\\(\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\\)",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem about parameterizing a line using vectors, and I need to figure out which of the given options are valid. Let me recall what a parameterization of a line looks like.\n\nI remember that a line in vector form is usually written as **r** = **r₀** + t**v**, where **r₀** is a point on the line (the position vector) and **v** is the direction vector. The variable t is a parameter that can take any real number value, which effectively moves along the line as t changes.\n\nSo, each of these options seems to fit that structure. Each one has an initial vector (probably **r₀**) and then a direction vector multiplied by a scalar t. That seems right. But is there more to it?\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each option individually to ensure that they are correctly parameterized lines. The main things I need to check are:\n\n1. **Does the initial point lie on the line when t = 0?** That should be true because when t is zero, the vector becomes just **r₀**, which is a specific point on the line.\n\n2. **Is the direction vector consistent with the line?** Hmm, actually, the direction vector just defines the slope of the line, so without knowing the specific line these are supposed to represent, I might not need to check that. Unless, of course, the line is given somewhere, but in the problem statement, it doesn't specify. It just says \"a line is to be parameterized using vectors.\" So maybe all that matters is that the equation is in the form **r** = **r₀** + t**v**, which is the standard parameterization.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is testing if each option correctly represents some line, but without a specific line given, it's just about whether each equation is a valid parameterization. So perhaps, all options are valid, but that seems unlikely because in the past problems, only some are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. It says \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, actually, the line is the same as the given vector equations? Maybe no, actually, each option is a different line. So each option is a different parameterization, but are they all valid? Or maybe some are not because perhaps they don't actually represent lines or the initial points and direction vectors are conflicting.\n\nWait, no, parameterizations of lines should have the initial point as a point on the line and the direction vector as a scalar multiple of the line's direction. So, in each case, if it's written as a point plus t times a direction vector, then it's a valid parameterization for the line passing through that point with that direction.\n\nSo, unless there is something else that I'm missing here, all options might be valid. But wait, the problem is from an old exam and multiple choice. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a question about whether these equations represent the same line or not? No, the problem says \"a line is to be parameterized,\" but the options are different, so each option is a different line.\n\nWait, so the problem is probably about whether each given vector equation is a valid parameterization of some line in 2D space. Since each of them is in the form **r** = **r₀** + t**v**, they are all valid parameterizations as long as t is a real number.\n\nTherefore, all options A, B, C, D, E are valid parameterizations because each is of the form initial point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, there shouldn't be any invalid ones here.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the question is not about different lines, but about a single line parameterized in different ways. Hmm, actually, reading the problem again: \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, perhaps all options are parameterizations of the same line?\n\nIn that case, the validity depends on whether each option actually represents the same specific line. That would require comparing each parameterization to see if they describe the same line. How can we check if two parameterizations represent the same line?\n\nWell, two parameterizations represent the same line if their initial points lie on the same line and their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.\n\nSo, maybe the problem is asking whether each parameterization corresponds to the same line? Hmm, that would make more sense as a specific problem, rather than just \"valid parameterizations\" since all of them would technically be parameterizations, just of different lines.\n\nBut the problem says, \"a line is to be parameterized,\" not \"which of these parameterizations describe the same line,\" so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded such that all options are parameterizations of different lines, but it's just asking whether each individual option is a valid parameterization, regardless of what the line is. In that case, all of them are valid, as they fit the structure **r** = **r₀** + t**v**.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the options are not valid because, perhaps, in the question, the line is supposed to be a specific line, and the equations don't correspond. But in the problem as stated, there is no specific line given. Therefore, perhaps all options are valid.\n\nWait, but considering that the system could be expecting multiple correct options, but perhaps not all.\n\nWait, in the original problem statement, let me check: \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo, actually, maybe it is a single line. So each of these is supposed to be a parameterization of the same line, and we have to check whether each is a valid parameterization.\n\nBut if that's the case, then how to check whether they parameterize the same line?\n\nTo check if two parameterizations correspond to the same line, the direction vectors should be scalar multiples of each other, and the initial points must lie on the line defined by the direction vector.\n\nBut without knowing which specific line it is, or given that, perhaps all of them are lines, but different. So, perhaps the problem is just asking which parameterizations are correctly formed.\n\nTherefore, as long as each option is written in the correct form, which is a point plus t times a direction vector, they are all valid.\n\nBut wait, in that case, all of them are correct. But let me see the options again:\n\n(A) starts at (4,1) and has direction (-3, -5)\n\n(B) starts at (17,5) and direction (6,10)\n\n(C) starts at (2, -7/3) with direction (3/5,1)\n\n(D) starts at (14/5, -1) with direction (1, 3/5)\n\n(E) starts at (0, -17/3) with direction (15, -25)\n\nSo, I think that regardless of where they start or the direction, each is a valid parameterization because it is of the form **r₀** + t**v**.\n\nTherefore, I think all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations. But that can't be right, because in the problem statement, it's presented as a multiple-choice question where you need to input the letters, implying that only some are correct. So, perhaps the issue is that some parameterizations are not straight lines?\n\nWait, but all these are parameterizations of lines, so none of them are curves or something else.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the issue is that the direction vectors have to be non-zero? But all given direction vectors are non-zero, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vectors have to be consistent with some implicit line equation given elsewhere. But as the problem only mentions parameterizing a line, and each option is in the correct parameterization form, I think all are valid.\n\nWait, maybe when t is a real number, some of them might not actually cover all the points of the line? For example, direction vectors can be scaled, but as long as they are consistent, it's fine. Hmm, but scaling t will change how the parameterization progresses, but doesn't affect the line itself.\n\nWait, unless a direction vector is a zero vector, but none of the direction vectors here are zero vectors. Let me check:\n\n(A) direction (-3, -5) - not zero\n\n(B) direction (6,10) - not zero\n\n(C) direction (3/5, 1) - not zero\n\n(D) direction (1, 3/5) - not zero\n\n(E) direction (15, -25) - not zero\n\nSo, direction vectors are all non-zero, so all parameterizations are valid as equations for lines.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is about whether the equations define lines, not necessarily the same line. But since the problem just says \"which of the following options are valid parameterizations,\" it doesn't specify which particular line, so as long as each is of the correct form, which they are, they are all valid.\n\nWait, but then again, in some textbooks, parameterizations are considered valid only if the initial point is on the line corresponding to the direction vector, but in reality, it's always true because substituting t=0 gives the initial point, which is on the line defined by the direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, problems might say, \"Is the line... parameterized by...\", but in that case, you have to check if both the point and direction vector correspond.\n\nBut in this problem, since the direction vector is just given with any t, they're all standard parameterizations. So, perhaps, all options are correct.\n\nBut since the user originally wrote \"which of the following options are valid parameterizations,\" and didn't specify \"for a particular line,\" perhaps the answer is all of them.\n\nBut that can't be because, in that case, the answer would be A, B, C, D, E, but in the initial problem statement, it says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" That implies that it's possible to have multiple correct answers, but in the instruction above, the user is thinking through it.\n\nWait, hold on. Perhaps I misunderstood. Maybe \"a line is to be parameterized,\" so each option is attempting to parameterize a line, but given no specific line, the validity is in the structure, which is that each is in vector form with an initial point and direction vector. So, as such, all options are valid. So all letters A through E should be included.\n\nBut wait, given that all options are correct, but in the problem statement, the user was told to \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So perhaps all are correct, so the answer is A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut hold on, actually, in some cases, a parameterization can be written with a different direction vector if scaled by a constant. For instance, in option B, direction vector is (6,10), which is just 2 times (3,5), so it's a scalar multiple, which would still be a direction vector for the same line. However, unless the original line is defined in a specific direction, it's all relative.\n\nAlternatively, if the question was to check if they represent the same line, but since the problem doesn't specify that, I think it's just checking the basic parameterization form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the direction vector is normalized or in a particular format. But unless specified, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the options have direction vectors with denominator fractions, but no, in all options, direction vectors are just vectors in components.\n\nSo, unless I've missed something, all options are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, if that's the case, why does the user need to list them? Because the user is saying \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.\"\n\nBut if all options are correct, then the answer is A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut before finalizing that, perhaps there is a miscalculation. Let me check if any of the direction vectors could be incompatible.\n\nWait, no, because regardless of the direction vector, as long as t is a real number, any direction vector will just parameterize the line. So scaling or changing the direction doesn't make a parameterization invalid.\n\nTherefore, yes, all options are correct.\n\nWait, but in my experience with exams, sometimes they give parameterizations with different starting points and direction vectors for the same line, and you have to figure out which is correct or not. But without a specific line equation, that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these are meant to be in different forms, but in the problem statement, it just says \"parameterized using vectors,\" so no. Hence, I think all are correct.\n\nBut in the initial problem statement, the user wrote \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSince each is a line, not necessarily the same line, and each is parameterized correctly, so they should all be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think of another angle. If the problem is referring to a specific line, perhaps defined earlier, then maybe some of these aren't.\n\nBut given that it's a separate problem, no, there is no specific line given here.\n\nHence, the answer is all of them, so A, B, C, D, E.\n\nWait, but that seems unlikely because such problems usually have one or two correct options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to check whether each option is a valid parameterization of a straight line. Since they all are, as it is a standard parameterization of a line.\n\nWait, or perhaps a question about velocity vector or something else, but in the problem statement, it's just parameterizing a line, so I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe to check if they pass through the origin, but they don't necessarily have to. So for example, option A starts at (4,1), so it's not passing through origin unless (4,1) is on the line. But since the direction vector is (-3, -5), which would imply if you go opposite direction, you'd reach (4,1) + t*(-3, -5). For t=4/3, you might reach origin.\n\nWait, no, to check if a parameterization passes through origin, set x=0, y=0.\n\nSo, let's do this for each option:\n\n(A) Start (4,1), direction (-3, -5). When is 4 - 3t = 0 and 1 -5t=0?\n\nFrom x: 4 - 3t = 0 ⇒ t = 4/3\n\nFrom y: 1 -5t =0 ⇒ t = 1/5\n\nSince t cannot be both 4/3 and 1/5, so the line does not pass through the origin.\n\n(B) Start (17,5), direction (6,10). When is 17 +6t = 0 and 5 +10t = 0?\n\nFrom x: 17 +6t=0 ⇒ t= -17/6 ≈ -2.83\n\nFrom y:5 +10t=0 ⇒ t= -0.5\n\nNot equal, so it does not pass through the origin.\n\nSimilarly, for all options, set x=0 and y=0 and see if t is consistent.\n\n(C) Start (2, -7/3), direction (3/5,1). When is 2 + (3/5)t =0 and (-7/3) + t =0?\n\nFrom x: 2 + (3/5)t = 0 ⇒ (3/5)t = -2 ⇒ t= (-2)*(5/3)= -10/3 ≈ -3.33\n\nFrom y: (-7/3) + t =0 ⇒ t=7/3≈2.33\n\nNot same, so doesn't pass through origin.\n\n(D) Start (14/5, -1), direction (1, 3/5). When is 14/5 + t=0 and (-1) + (3/5)t=0.\n\nFrom x: t= -14/5= -2.8\n\nFrom y: -1 + (3/5)t=0 ⇒ (3/5)t=1 ⇒ t=5/3≈1.666\n\nNot same, so doesn't pass through origin.\n\n(E) Start (0, -17/3), direction (15, -25). When is 0 +15t=0 and (-17/3) -25t=0.\n\nFrom x: t=0.\n\nFrom y: -17/3 -25t=0 ⇒ t= (-17/3)/25= -17/(75)≈-0.226\n\nSo, inconsistent, so doesn't pass through origin.\n\nHmm, so none of them pass through the origin, but none of them was given as being supposed to pass through the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem wants them to be straight lines, but they already are. Alternatively, maybe some are not lines because the direction vectors are not consistent with lines?\n\nNo, wait, in 2D, direction vectors are just vectors, so they just define the slope.\n\nWait, alternatively, is there something about being a straight line? But all are linear in t, so they're all straight lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of them cannot represent all lines because of scaling?\n\nBut I think that isn't an issue here. So, it's just that all are parameterizations.\n\nWait, but if none pass through the origin, but no requirement was made on that, so they can pass through anywhere.\n\nTherefore, all parameterizations are correct.\n\nWait, unless a parameterization is invalid because the initial point is not on the line, but in this case, each one is, because if t=0, you get the initial point.\n\nWait, but hold on. In option C, direction vector is (3/5,1). So, if t=0, we are at (2, -7/3), which is on the line.\n\nSimilarly for other options, their initial points are on the respective lines.\n\nTherefore, all are valid.\n\nTherefore, I think all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut then, in that case, I think the answer is all letters, A,B,C,D,E.\n\nBut hold on, when I thought of multiple-choice options, it's more likely that some are incorrect. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe some of the direction vectors have discontinuities or something? No, direction vectors are just vectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of them has a zero vector? No, checked already.\n\nWait, maybe the direction vectors are incorrect? For example, is the direction vector a multiple of the vector from initial point to somewhere else?\n\nWait, no, direction vectors don't have to do with the initial points, they just define the slope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about expressing the same line with different parameterizations, but the problem didn't specify that. It just says \"valid parameterizations.\"\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, all the options are valid because they are each of the form **",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about parameterizing a line using vectors. I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations. There are five options labeled (A) through (E). \n\nFirst, let me recall what a parameterization of a line looks like. A line in vector form is generally given by the equation:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\mathbf{a}$ is a specific point on the line (called the point of origin or the base point).\n- $\\mathbf{b}$ is the direction vector of the line. It indicates the direction in which the line extends.\n- $t$ is a scalar parameter that can take any real value.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to check two things:\n1. Is the given point ($\\mathbf{a}$) a valid point on the line? (This might depend on additional context not given here, so perhaps it's more about the structure rather than specific validity without more info.)\n2. Is the direction vector ($\\mathbf{b}$) correct in terms of direction? (Again, if the line is supposed to have a specific direction, but as the problem just says \"a line is to be parameterized,\" I think the direction vector is acceptable as long as it is a non-zero vector.)\n\nWait, maybe more precisely, each option defines a line in vector form. So, for each option, as long as it's written as a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector, it's a valid parameterization, right? Or is there more to it?\n\nHold on, perhaps each option represents a line, but we need to ensure that the direction vector is consistent with the line it's supposed to represent. But wait, the problem doesn't give any specific constraints on the lines except that they are lines, so as long as each option is of the form point plus t times direction vector, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is not with the form but perhaps whether the direction vector is scaled appropriately or something else. Or maybe in some cases, the direction vector is zero, which would not define a line, but looking at the options, all direction vectors have components, so none of them are zero vectors.\n\nWait, let me check that. The options are:\n\n(A) Direction vector: (-3, -5)\n(B) Direction vector: (6, 10)\n(C) Direction vector: (3/5, 1)\n(D) Direction vector: (1, 3/5)\n(E) Direction vector: (15, -25)\n\nAll of these have non-zero components, so none are zero vectors. Therefore, all these are lines parameterized by vectors. So is the question just asking to identify which are correctly formed vector equations of a line?\n\nIf that's the case, then all of them are technically valid. But perhaps, maybe the original problem was not presented in full? Because it says, \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" It might not necessarily mean all are valid, but perhaps the lines might not actually be lines or might be the same line, but that's not specified here.\n\nWait, no, each of these is a distinct line because each has a different base point and/or direction vector.\n\nWait, is there a more subtle aspect? Perhaps if the direction vector is not consistent with the line equation? But I don't think so because the parameterization is in vector form, so as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it's a valid line.\n\nBut maybe, the question is referring to direction vectors being scalar multiples? Because if two parameterizations have direction vectors that are scalar multiples, then they represent the same line but with different parametrizations.\n\nBut since the question is asking if the given options are valid parameterizations, not necessarily unique, so even if two have the same line but different parameters, both would be valid. So perhaps all of them are valid.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe in the original question, there's a specific line given, but it's not here. Since the problem says, \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" It doesn't specify the particular line, so perhaps all options are valid as they are all correctly formed.\n\nWait, but the options have different direction vectors. For example, (A) has direction (-3, -5), while (E) has (15, -25). Wait, hold on, is (-3, -5) a scalar multiple of (15, -25)? Let's check:\n\nIf we multiply (-3, -5) by -5, we get (15, 25). But the direction vector in (E) is (15, -25). The y-component has a different sign. So they are not scalar multiples, which would mean they are different lines.\n\nBut does that affect validity as parameterizations? No, because each is a different line.\n\nSimilarly, let me check (B) and (E): (6, 10) can be simplified to (3, 5). Similarly, (15, -25) can be simplified to (3, -5). These are different direction vectors because one is (3,5) and the other is (3, -5). So, different lines.\n\nTherefore, I think each option is a valid parameterization as long as it is in the form point plus scalar times direction vector, which all of them are.\n\nWait, but let's be more precise. The standard vector equation for a line is given by a point on the line plus a scalar times a direction vector. So all options conform to that, so all are valid.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" and the user is asking for the letters separated by commas. So, maybe each option is a possible parameterization, but perhaps some of them have issues such as direction vectors being zero or lines not passing through the given point.\n\nBut earlier, we saw all direction vectors are non-zero, so no problem there.\n\nBut let's check if each point lies on the line corresponding to the given direction vector. Wait, but without any specific reference line, this is not necessary. So perhaps in this context, all these parameterizations are valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the original question, there was a specific line given, but it's missing here. Without that, it's impossible to say if the direction vectors align with some given line.\n\nSince the problem is only about parameterizing a line, and the options just give different parameterizations, each in the correct form. So as long as they are in the form point plus scalar times direction vector, they are valid.\n\nWait, unless there's a mistake in the question. Wait, no, this is a user input, the problem as given is as above.\n\nHmm, so perhaps all the options are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut then why does the user specify entering the letters separated by commas? So perhaps, the user expects that some are invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps in the problem, each option is presented as a vector equation, but maybe the format is written incorrectly.\n\nWait, all the options are written as:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\text{point} + t \\cdot \\text{direction vector}$\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, in that case, all are valid.\n\nBut that seems too easy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was referring to whether the direction vector is correctly scaled or in the same direction, but scaling doesn't affect validity, just the parametrization's speed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the purposes of the problem, a line is defined with specific direction, but since they are different, it's okay.\n\nWait, but maybe the confusion is that in some parameterizations, the base point isn't consistent with the direction vector? Wait, no, the base point is arbitrary.\n\nFor example, a line can be parameterized from different points with different direction vectors and it's still the same line.\n\nWait, unless some of the direction vectors are pointing in the opposite direction, but that still defines the same line, just traversed in the opposite direction.\n\nBut again, all of them are valid.\n\nWait, unless some of the direction vectors have zero components, but all direction vectors have non-zero components. Wait, for option (C), the direction vector is (3/5, 1), which is fine. Similarly for (D), it's (1, 3/5). Also fine.\n\nSo perhaps, since all of them have non-zero direction vectors, all are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but then why are there five options? It might be that some of them have a zero vector, but as per my check, none do.\n\nWait, let me re-examine each direction vector:\n\n(A) (-3, -5) - non-zero\n(B) (6,10) - non-zero\n(C) (3/5,1) - non-zero\n(D) (1, 3/5) - non-zero\n(E) (15, -25) - non-zero\n\nSo all direction vectors are non-zero, which is necessary for the parameterization to represent a line. So all are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, maybe it was referring to whether the direction vectors are consistent with the lines. But without any specific reference lines, this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the initial problem, the direction vector is fixed, but with different base points, but again, without specific context, it's not clear.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's just asking if each is a valid parameterization. So the answer would be all of them.\n\nBut wait, before I conclude that, maybe I should check if each equation actually represents a line. For that, the direction vector has to be non-zero, which all are, so yes.\n\nTherefore, perhaps all options are valid.\n\nBut wait, maybe when the direction vector is zero? But no, none have zero direction vectors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each is a valid equation for a line in the plane, regardless of the specific direction, as long as the direction vector is non-zero.\n\nHence, all five options are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem statement was: \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So in the original problem, perhaps there's a line defined with a certain direction, and they are checking whether the parameterizations correspond to that line.\n\nBut since the line isn't specified here, and just asked if the given parameterizations are valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be all options.\n\nBut the user says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nGiven that, if all are correct, the answer should be A,B,C,D,E.\n\nBut in case I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem was part of a larger problem where lines were given, and the parameterizations were supposed to match, but since that isn't here, perhaps all are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that in some cases, the direction vector could be expressed differently but still representing the same direction.\n\nWait, for instance, option (B) has a direction vector (6,10), which can be simplified by dividing by 2, giving (3,5). Similarly, option (A) has (-3,-5), which is the negative of (3,5). So both (A) and (B) have direction vectors that are scalar multiples of each other. So they represent the same line but in opposite directions.\n\nBut since both are valid, they are still different parameterizations of the same line.\n\nSo unless the problem was referring to unique parameterizations, but the question is about validity, so even if they parameterize the same line, both are still valid parameterizations.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is all options A through E are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of a line, we need to check if each option is in the correct vector form. A line in vector form is generally given by:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a specific point on the line.\n- \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector.\n- \\(t\\) is a scalar parameter.\n\nEach option must be checked to ensure it is in the correct form and that the direction vector is non-zero.\n\n- **Option (A)**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)  \n  The direction vector \\((-3, -5)\\) is non-zero.\n\n- **Option (B)**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\)  \n  The direction vector \\((6, 10)\\) is non-zero.\n\n- **Option (C)**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)  \n  The direction vector \\((3/5, 1)\\) is non-zero.\n\n- **Option (D)**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)  \n  The direction vector \\((1, 3/5)\\) is non-zero.\n\n- **Option (E)**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\)  \n  The direction vector \\((15, -25)\\) is non-zero.\n\nSince all options are in the correct vector form and have non-zero direction vectors, all are valid parameterizations.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations for a line. The options are labeled (A) through (E), and each one provides a starting point (a vector) and a direction vector multiplied by a parameter t. I remember that a valid parameterization of a line in vector form should consist of a point on the line and a direction vector. \n\nLet me recall the general form of a parameterized line. It should look like this: \n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}$ is a specific point on the line, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the direction vector that defines the slope of the line. The parameter t can be any real number. So, as long as each option provides a specific point and a direction vector, it's a valid parameterization. \n\nWait, but is there any catch? For example, do the direction vectors have to be in their simplest form or something? Or maybe the starting points? Hmm, no, I don't think so. Because parameterization is about expressing all points on the line as you vary t. The direction vector just needs to point in the correct direction, regardless of its magnitude. So even if the direction vector can be scaled, it's still valid. \n\nSo, perhaps the key is to check whether each option provides a point and a direction vector. Let me look at each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (A):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAlright, here, the starting point is (4, 1) and the direction vector is (-3, -5). There doesn't seem to be any issue here. So, this is definitely a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe starting point is (17, 5), and the direction vector is (6, 10). Again, no red flags here. So, this should be valid.\n\nNow, option (C):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe starting point here is (2, -7/3), which is a bit messy with the fraction, but it's still a valid point in the plane. The direction vector is (3/5, 1). Hmm, is there any problem with fractions? I don't think so because direction vectors can have fractions. So, this should be a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving to option (D):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe starting point is (14/5, -1). That's another fraction, but again, valid. The direction vector is (1, 3/5). Fractions are fine here as well. So, I don't see any issue with this parameterization. It should be valid.\n\nNow, option (E):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nStarting point is (0, -17/3). The direction vector is (15, -25). Hmm, here's a thought. Is the direction vector (15, -25) perhaps a scalar multiple of the starting point? Wait, the starting point is (0, -17/3), and the direction vector is (15, -25). But the direction vector starts from (0, -17/3). However, I don't think that affects the validity of the parameterization because the parameter t can vary independently. \n\nBut let me think: if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the starting point, but no, the starting point is a position vector, and the direction vector is separate. They don't need to be related. So, this is still a valid parameterization. The line will pass through (0, -17/3) and extend in the direction of (15, -25). \n\nWait, maybe the direction vector can be simplified or scaled? Let me see if I can reduce (15, -25) by a factor of 5, which would give (3, -5). So, the direction vector is essentially equivalent to (3, -5), but scaled by 5. So, as a direction vector, scaling doesn't affect the line; it just changes the speed at which you move along the line. So, that should still be fine.\n\nSo, after reviewing all options, it seems like each one provides a starting point and a direction vector. Therefore, all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait a second, hold on. Let me make sure that each starting point is correct in terms of matching the direction vector. Or is that necessary?\n\nI think that's not required for a parameterization. A parameterization just needs to express the line as a point plus a direction. It doesn't have to satisfy a particular equation unless specified, which it isn't in this case. So, even if, for example, if the direction vector is not consistent with the starting point, it's still fine because t is just a scalar.\n\nSo, for example, in option (C), the direction vector is (3/5, 1). If I wanted to represent this line in another form, say, by plugging in t = 0, it gives (2, -7/3). Then, for t = 1, it's (2 + 3/5, -7/3 + 1) = (13/5, -4/3). So, it's moving along that direction. Similarly, other points would just follow. So, as such, it's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for option (E), starting at (0, -17/3), moving in the direction of (15, -25). So, for t=1, it's (15, -42/3 -25/1) Hmm, let's calculate: Starting at (0, -17/3), t=1 gives (15, -17/3 -25). Wait, -17/3 is approximately -5.666, so minus 25 is about -30.666, which is -92/3. So, the point is (15, -92/3). Is that lying on the line? Let me see.\n\nBut I think regardless of specific points, as long as the direction is correct, the parameterization is valid.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think: when writing the parameterization, does the direction vector need to be consistent with the slope from the starting point? For example, is the direction vector's slope the same as the line's slope?\n\nBut actually, the parameterization doesn't impose any condition on the starting point and the direction vector's relationship. Because even if the direction vector is (0,1), starting at (1,0), the line is horizontal? No, wait, the direction vector (0,1) would imply a vertical line. So, maybe if the starting point is (1,0) with direction (0,1), that's a vertical line. Similarly, direction (1,0) from (0,0) is a horizontal line.\n\nBut wait, another thought: For a line parameterized by (x,y) = a + t*b, the direction vector is indeed the direction of the line, independent of the starting point. So, the starting point can be any point on the line, and the direction vector defines the slope.\n\nBut, in that case, is the line determined uniquely by the starting point and the direction vector? Yes, because no matter where you start, moving in a given direction gives the same line. So, therefore, the parameterization is valid.\n\nSo, that would mean that all of these options are valid parameterizations. Hmm, but I might be misremembering something.\n\nWait, no, hold on, maybe not all are. Let me think again. If the direction vector is the zero vector, then it would just give the same point repeated, which is invalid as a line. But in none of these options is the direction vector the zero vector, because each has a non-zero direction vector.\n\nTherefore, none of the options are invalid due to that reason.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps the starting point needs to be such that when you plug t=0, the point is indeed on the line? Well, in a line, all points are valid. So, maybe that's not necessary.\n\nWait, actually, a parameterization just represents all points on the line as t varies. So, the starting point is just one point on the line, and the direction vector determines the entire line.\n\nSo, in that case, as long as each option gives a starting point and a direction vector, it's a valid parameterization, regardless of where the point is or what the direction vector is.\n\nThus, I think all options (A) through (E) are valid. But that seems a bit strange because sometimes in problems like this, certain options might have direction vectors that are zero or starting points not lying on the line, but in this case, all starting points seem to be points on their respective lines.\n\nWait, no, actually, the starting point is supposed to lie on the line that the parameterization defines. So, but in a parameterization, the starting point is any point on the line, so it's inherent. Therefore, all that's needed is that each starting point is on the line and the direction vector is a direction for the line.\n\nBut in this problem, since the question is only about whether the parameterization is valid, not about whether it represents a specific line equation or not.\n\nWait, actually, no, in a parameterization, the starting point and direction vector define the line. So, as long as the starting point is on the line, then it's fine.\n\nBut since the problem is not giving an equation of the line, just giving the parameterizations, each one is a valid way to express a line, regardless of where the starting point is or the direction vector is. So, all of them are valid.\n\nWait, but wait, in some cases, when the direction vector is a scalar multiple, but direction vectors can be any non-zero vector, regardless of their magnitude or fractions or what.\n\nWait, I think I need to think of it in another way: when is a parameterization invalid? If the direction vector is a zero vector, then the parameterization doesn't define a line, but a single point. In none of the options is the direction vector zero. For example, (A) has direction vector (-3, -5), which is non-zero. (B) has (6, 10). (C) has (3/5, 1), (D) has (1, 3/5), and (E) has (15, -25). All non-zero vectors. So, none are zero vectors, so all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nSo, therefore, the correct answer is all options (A) through (E). But I think in the given problem, perhaps I'm supposed to check only for some specific validity. Wait, the problem is asking \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, is it possible that some of them are not valid, maybe due to the starting point or direction vector conflicting? Or maybe because of the specific direction vector being a multiple?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction vector in (E) is inconsistent with the starting point? Let me check that.\n\nIn option (E), the starting point is (0, -17/3) and the direction vector is (15, -25). So, is the direction vector correctly scaled? Let me see, from (0, -17/3), moving in the direction of (15, -25). For example, for t=1, the point is (15, -17/3 -25). Wait, that would be (15, (-17 -75)/3) = (15, -92/3). Is that a valid point on the line?\n\nBut actually, a parameterization doesn't require the direction vector to be consistent with the starting point; it just defines the line regardless of where you start. So, perhaps the issue is whether the starting point is correctly given, but I don't think that's the case because in a parameterization, the starting point is arbitrary as long as it's on the line.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps, the direction vector should be such that it can reach the starting point? No, that doesn't make sense because the starting point is where t=0. It's not like you have to reach it from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps if the direction vector is zero, as I thought earlier, which makes it invalid. But that's not the case here. So, as I can't find any reason why any of the options is invalid, I think they are all valid. So, all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations. Therefore, the answer is (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\nBut wait, before I finish, let me double-check each option.\n\nStarting with (A):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nYes, that looks fine. The direction vector is (-3, -5), which is a valid non-zero vector, starting at (4,1). So, valid.\n\nOption (B):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSame reasoning. The direction vector is (6,10), which is non-zero. Starting at (17,5). Valid.\n\nOption (C):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nStarting point is (2, -7/3), direction vector is (3/5, 1). Both are non-zero, so it's a valid parameterization.\n\nOption (D):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nStarting point (14/5, -1), direction vector (1, 3/5). Non-zero, so valid.\n\nOption (E):\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nStarting point (0, -17/3), direction vector (15, -25). Both non-zero, so valid.\n\nSo, unless I've made a mistake in my reasoning, all options are valid parameterizations. Therefore, the answer is all of them: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another approach. Perhaps plug in t=1 into each parameterization and see if it makes sense.\n\nFor (A): t=1: (4-3, 1-5) = (1, -4). The line connecting (4,1) and (1,-4) has a slope of (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which is consistent with the direction vector (-3, -5). Wait, no, actually, the direction vector's slope is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, so yeah, consistent.\n\nOption (B): t=1: (17+6,5+10)=(23,15). The line from (17,5) to (23,15) has a slope of (10)/(6)=5/3, which is consistent with direction vector (6,10). So, that's correct.\n\nOption (C): t=1: (2 + 3/5, -7/3 +1) = (13/5, -4/3). Let me see, starting at (2, -7/3), so moving in the direction of (3/5,1). So, that seems correct.\n\nOption (D): t=1: (14/5 +1, -1 + 3/5) = (19/5, -2/5). The direction vector is (1, 3/5), so the line from (14/5, -1) to (19/5, -2/5) is correct, slope is ( (-2/5 - (-1)) / (1) ) = (3/5)/1 = 3/5.\n\nOption (E): t=1: (0 +15, -17/3 -25) = (15, -17/3 -75/3) = (15, -92/3). The direction vector is (15, -25), so the slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3. Let me see, the line from (0, -17/3) to (15, -92/3). The change in y is (-92/3 +17/3)= (-75/3)=-25. Change in x is 15, so slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is consistent with direction vector.\n\nTherefore, after plugging in t=1 and computing the slope, all are consistent with their direction vectors. Thus, all are valid parameterizations.\n\nSo, yes, all options are valid. Therefore, the correct answer is all of them: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given options (A through E) are valid parameterizations of a line. Each option is given in the form of a vector equation, which I remember is a common way to parameterize a line in 2D space. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a parameterization of a line looks like. In general, a line can be expressed as \\(\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a point on the line (the position vector), \\(t\\) is a scalar parameter, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector of the line. So, for each option, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Does the given equation correctly represent a line in 2D? That is, does it have a point \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) and a direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)?\n2. Is there any issue with the parameters, like if the direction vector is zero or something else? But wait, in 2D, as long as the direction vector isn't the zero vector, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nHmm, but actually, thinking a bit more, in 2D, the parameterization will always be a line, regardless of the values, as long as the direction vector isn't zero. So, the main thing to check for each option is whether the direction vector is a non-zero vector. Because if the direction vector is zero, then the parameterization would just be a single point, not a line.\n\nSo, maybe I should go through each option, check the direction vector (the part being multiplied by \\(t\\)), and see if it's non-zero. If it is, then it's a valid parameterization; if it's zero, then it's not.\n\nLet's start with option (A):\n\n(A) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nSo, the direction vector here is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Is this a non-zero vector? Yes, because both components are non-zero (-3 and -5). So, this is a valid parameterization. Therefore, (A) is correct.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\n(B) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nThe direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Again, both components are non-zero (6 and 10), so it's a non-zero vector. Therefore, this is a valid parameterization. So, (B) is correct.\n\nOption (C):\n\n(C) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nDirection vector here is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Both components are non-zero, so again, non-zero vector. Thus, it's a valid parameterization. Therefore, (C) is correct.\n\nOption (D):\n\n(D) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nDirection vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Both components are non-zero. Hence, non-zero vector, so (D) is valid.\n\nOption (E):\n\n(E) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nDirection vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Both components are non-zero; 15 and -25. So, this is a valid direction vector, meaning it's a valid parameterization. Thus, (E) is correct.\n\nWait, hold on a second. That seems too straightforward. The problem didn't specify any specific constraints or maybe different forms, so all these seem correct. Let me double-check each direction vector to make sure none are zero.\n\nFor (A): direction vector is [-3, -5]. Neither component is zero. Valid.\n\n(B): [6, 10]. Neither component is zero. Valid.\n\n(C): [3/5, 1]. 3/5 is non-zero, 1 is non-zero. Valid.\n\n(D): [1, 3/5]. 1 is non-zero, 3/5 is non-zero. Valid.\n\n(E): [15, -25]. 15 is non-zero, -25 is non-zero. Valid.\n\nSo, all options except maybe some with direction vector zero would be correct, but none of them have direction vector zero. So, all (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? The problem says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, all could be correct? Maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem lies in whether the parametric equations are correctly written for a line, but the form is correct as given. Each one provides a point and a direction vector, so they are all lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the parameterization in some specific form, like requiring the direction vector to be in its simplest terms or something. But as far as I can tell, since all direction vectors are non-zero, all are valid.\n\nHmm. Maybe another point is that if the direction vector could be expressed as a scalar multiple of another direction vector, but that's still fine because multiple direction vectors can describe the same line. So, that wouldn't affect validity.\n\nWait, unless the question is about whether the parametrization covers the entire line or not. For example, if the parameter \\(t\\) is restricted to a specific interval, it becomes a line segment instead of a line. But looking at the options, all use \\(t\\) without any restrictions, so each represents the entire line, not just a segment. Thus, they are all valid.\n\nWait, actually, another thought. In 2D, the parametric equations should be linear in \\(t\\), which they are in all the options. So, maybe all these are correct.\n\nBut I was expecting maybe some to be incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, could there be an issue with the point? For example, if in option (A), the point is (4,1), which is correct, and direction vector is (-3,-5). So, that should be okay.\n\nSimilarly, point (17,5) in (B), direction vector (6,10). It's okay.\n\nIn (C), (2, -7/3) with direction vector (3/5, 1). That seems fine.\n\nIn (D), (14/5, -1) with direction vector (1, 3/5). Also fine.\n\nIn (E), (0, -17/3) with direction vector (15, -25). That's also fine.\n\nI don't see any issue with the points or direction vectors. All direction vectors are non-zero, so they are all valid.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but that seems unusual because sometimes problems have options where the direction vector might be scalar multiples or something else.\n\nWait, in (C), the direction vector is (3/5, 1), and in (E), it's (15, -25). Hmm, let me see. If in (E), the direction vector is (15, -25). Is this a multiple of something else?\n\nWell, (15, -25) can be simplified by factoring out a 5, which would give 5*(3, -5). So, it's just a scalar multiple of (3, -5). Similarly, in (A), the direction vector is (-3, -5). So, direction vector (3,5) is same as (3,5), but in (A) it's (-3, -5). Hmm, that's just a negative direction. So, same line, just traversed in the opposite direction.\n\nSimilarly, in (B), direction vector is (6,10), which can be reduced by dividing both components by 2, getting (3,5). Similarly, in (E), it's (15, -25) which is 5*(3, -5). So, same idea, different direction vectors.\n\nBut, regardless, the key is that as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it's a valid parameterization. So, all of them are okay.\n\nWait, but maybe in some of them, the direction vector is a zero vector. Let me verify that.\n\nLooking at option (D): direction vector is [1, 3/5]. 1 is non-zero, 3/5 is non-zero, so that's non-zero.\n\nOption (C): [3/5, 1]. Non-zero.\n\nOption (E): [15, -25]. Non-zero.\n\nHmm, so nope, none of the options have direction vectors with zero components. So, I think my initial thought was correct: all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me write down each direction vector and confirm again:\n\n(A) direction: [-3, -5] ✔️\n\n(B) direction: [6, 10] ✔️\n\n(C) direction: [3/5, 1] ✔️\n\n(D) direction: [1, 3/5] ✔️\n\n(E) direction: [15, -25] ✔️\n\nAll are non-zero vectors, so all are valid parameterizations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is all options from (A) to (E) are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, and \\boxed{E}.\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of a line, we need to check if each option has a non-zero direction vector. A valid parameterization of a line in 2D space is given by \\(\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a non-zero direction vector.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n\n(B) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n\n(C) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n\n(D) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n\n(E) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n\nSince all options have non-zero direction vectors, all are valid parameterizations.\n\n\\(\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\\)",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about parameterizing a line using vectors. I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations. There are five options labeled (A) through (E). Hmm, let me recall what a parameterization of a line should look like.\n\nFrom what I remember, a line in vector form is typically written as **r** = **a** + t**b**, where **a** is a point on the line and **b** is the direction vector of the line. The parameter t is a scalar that can take any real number value, which means we can generate infinitely many points on the line by plugging in different values of t. So, essentially, **a** is the starting point, and **b** gives the direction in which the line extends as t increases or decreases.\n\nNow, the question is about checking which of these options are valid. So, I need to go through each option one by one and see if it fits this form. Let me list the options again for clarity.\n\n(A) (x, y) = (4, 1) + t(-3, -5)\n\n(B) (x, y) = (17, 5) + t(6, 10)\n\n(C) (x, y) = (2, -7/3) + t(3/5, 1)\n\n(D) (x, y) = (14/5, -1) + t(1, 3/5)\n\n(E) (x, y) = (0, -17/3) + t(15, -25)\n\nSo, each option is given in the form (x, y) = (x₀, y₀) + t(b₁, b₂). Wait, actually, in the problem, they wrote it as matrices, but that's just another way of writing vectors. So, each (x, y) is expressed as a point plus t times a direction vector.\n\nSince all the options follow this structure, I might need to check if each one correctly represents a line. But wait, every equation of this form should represent a line, right? Unless the direction vector is zero, which would collapse the line to a single point, making it not a line. However, in all the options, the direction vectors have components, so none of them are zero vectors. Therefore, they all represent lines.\n\nBut hold on, maybe the problem is more subtle. Perhaps the issue is whether each parameterization actually corresponds to the same line, or maybe whether the direction vector is a scalar multiple of each other? Or perhaps not. The question just asks whether each option is a valid parameterization, regardless of direction or specific points. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem statement:\n\n\"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo, each option is a possible parameterization. Since all of them are given in the form **a** + t**b**, where **a** is a specific point and **b** is a direction vector, each of them is indeed a valid parameterization of the line that passes through **a** in the direction of **b**.\n\nTherefore, in that case, all options would be valid parameterizations, right? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking if the given parameterizations correspond to the same line? No, the wording says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" It doesn't specify a particular line, so each is a valid parameterization of some line. So, perhaps all of them are valid. But that seems odd because in the problem, the user might have made a mistake in copying the question, or perhaps the original line is given in another form, and they are to match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is actually about which parameterizations correspond to the same line, or whether the direction vectors are consistent with the point given.\n\nWait, but looking again, the user wrote: \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, all of these are attempts to parameterize some line. Each one is a line with a specific direction and passing through a specific point. So, each is a valid parameterization of that particular line.\n\nBut if that's the case, then all options are correct, right? So, (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) are all valid parameterizations.\n\nBut since that seems too straightforward, and in the initial instruction, the user might have confused line equations or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether each parameterization is correct given some specific line, which isn't provided here.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem: It says, \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" There's no specific line given in another form, so each of these is a valid parameterization of some line, regardless of others. So, all of them are correct.\n\nBut, hold on, sometimes in multiple-choice questions like this, \"valid parameterizations\" might refer to something else, like whether the parameterization is unique or whether certain conditions hold, such as direction vectors being non-zero or the point lying on the line. But in this case, direction vectors are non-zero, and points are arbitrary, so they all satisfy the condition of being a valid parameterization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the parameterizations as functions from R to R^2, which is standard in vector parameterizations, so yes, they all qualify.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the question is a trick question because it says \"valid\" parameterizations, and the problem is to choose all correct ones. Since all are in the correct form, all are valid. Therefore, the answer should be all of them: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E). But given the problem statement is from a student who might be confused, perhaps he missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking whether each vector is a valid direction vector or something. But no, direction vectors can be any non-zero vectors, so as long as they have two components, which they do, they are valid. So, indeed, all are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each one.\n\nStarting with (A):\n\nIt has a point (4,1) and direction vector (-3,-5). That's fine. So, that's a valid parameterization.\n\n(B): Point (17,5) with direction vector (6,10). Again, okay. Fine.\n\n(C): Point (2, -7/3) with direction vector (3/5, 1). Also valid.\n\n(D): Point (14/5, -1) with direction vector (1, 3/5). Also valid.\n\n(E): Point (0, -17/3) with direction vector (15, -25). That's also okay.\n\nTherefore, all of them are valid. Wait, but the problem is presented as a multiple-choice question where you need to select the correct letters. So, the answer is all of them: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E). So, is that correct?\n\nBut that seems conflicting because sometimes parameterizations might be considered invalid if they don't meet certain conditions, like if the direction vector is zero, but none of them do. Alternatively, maybe the lines are supposed to pass through some specific points? But since the problem didn't specify, each one is a valid line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each parameterization is supposed to pass through the origin or something, but that's not required in the definition of a line's parameterization. So, without additional constraints, each one is valid.\n\nWait, perhaps it's in the wording: \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors.\" It might mean that for a given line, which isn't specified here, each of these parameterizations is being considered, and the question is whether each is valid? But since we don't know the specific line, perhaps they are all valid if we don't have any further information. Therefore, without more context, all are valid.\n\nTherefore, I think all five options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but in that case, the answer would be all letters: A, B, C, D, E. But usually, in such problems, sometimes only some are correct. So, maybe my initial thought is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to find the parameterizations that are in the simplest form or something else? Maybe there's an issue with the parametrization being injective or something. But parameterizations of lines are generally not required to be injective unless specified. So, as long as it's in the form **a** + t**b**, where **b** is non-zero, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nTherefore, in that case, all the given options are valid.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is that they expect a specific line, and we are to check if the parameterizations correspond to that same line. But since the original line isn't given, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe all are correct.\n\nWait, let me see. Let me take each parameterization and write down the corresponding line.\n\nFor example, take (A): x = 4 - 3t, y = 1 -5t. So, eliminating t, we get (y - 1)/(-5) = t = (4 - x)/3. So, (y -1)/(-5) = (4 - x)/3. So, 3(y -1) = -5(4 - x). So, 3y -3 = -20 + 5x. So, 5x - 3y = 17. So, that's the line.\n\nSimilarly, (B): x =17 +6t, y=5 +10t. So, t=(x-17)/6. Plugging into y: y=5 +10*(x-17)/6=5 + (5/3)(x-17). Multiply through: y=5 + (5/3)x - 85/3. So, bringing 5 to the fraction: 5=15/3, so y=15/3 +5/3x -85/3= (5x -70)/3. Therefore, 3y=5x -70, so 5x -3y=70.\n\nSo, different line than (A). So, (A) and (B) are different lines.\n\nSimilarly, let me check (C):\n\nx=2 + (3/5)t, y= -7/3 + t. Let me eliminate t. From x: t=(x-2)*(5/3). Plug into y: y= -7/3 + (5/3)(x - 2)= -7/3 + (5/3)x -10/3= (5x)/3 -17/3. Multiply by 3: 3y=5x -17, so 5x -3y=17.\n\nWait, that's the same line as (A). Interesting.\n\nSo, option (C) parameterizes the same line as (A).\n\nSo, (A) and (C) are the same line. So, if the original line was, say, 5x -3y=17, then both (A) and (C) are valid parameterizations.\n\nSimilarly, let's check (D):\n\nx=14/5 + t, y= -1 + (3/5)t. Let me eliminate t.\n\nFrom x: t= x -14/5.\n\nPlug into y: y= -1 + (3/5)(x -14/5)= -1 + (3/5)x -42/25.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n-1 is -25/25, so -25/25 + (3/5)x -42/25= (3/5)x -67/25.\n\nMultiply both sides by 25: 25y=15x -67. So, 15x -25y=67.\n\nSo, that's a different line.\n\nOption (E): x=0 +15t, y= -17/3 -25t.\n\nEliminate t. From x: t= x/15.\n\nPlug into y: y= -17/3 -25*(x/15)= -17/3 - (5/3)x.\n\nMultiply through by 3: 3y= -17 -5x. So, 5x +3y= -17.\n\nSo, the line is 5x +3y= -17.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n(A) and (C) both parameterize the line 5x -3y=17.\n\n(B) parameterizes 5x -3y=70.\n\n(D) parameterizes 15x -25y=67.\n\n(E) parameterizes 5x +3y= -17.\n\nSo, each parameterization is of a different line, except for (A) and (C), which are the same.\n\nTherefore, all of them are valid parameterizations, just for different lines.\n\nTherefore, the answer is all of them.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"a line is to be parameterized\". So, if the original line wasn't given, then any parameterization of a line is valid, regardless of the specific line.\n\nBut in that case, all options are correct. But the question didn't specify a particular line.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects that all lines must be straight lines, but all these are straight lines, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parameterizations are incorrect because they don't start at the correct points or something, but no, any point on the line can be the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is whether the direction vectors are unit vectors, but again, no, direction vectors don't have to be unit vectors; any non-zero scalar multiple is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, but that's okay because multiple direction vectors can define the same line as long as they are scalar multiples. But in this case, no, the direction vectors are different.\n\nSo, considering all that, all parameterizations are valid, so all (A) through (E) are correct. Therefore, the answer is A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut the initial thought was that maybe the question was expecting a specific answer, like which of the options are parallel or something, but as it stands, the problem is asking for which are valid parameterizations, which all are.\n\nWait, unless the problem is actually miswritten, and it was supposed to say \"Which of the following are valid parameterizations of the line [something]?\" but without that, we cannot assume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of these is actually in different forms but still valid, so all are correct.\n\nTherefore, given that, I think all options are valid. So, I need to select all of them.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, and \\boxed{E}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of a line using vectors, we recall that a line in vector form is written as \\(\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{b}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector. Each option given is in the form \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is a valid parameterization as long as \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a non-zero vector.\n\nChecking each option:\n\n- (A) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is valid.\n- (B) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is valid.\n- (C) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is valid.\n- (D) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is valid.\n- (E) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is valid.\n\nEach option is a valid parameterization of a line, as they all follow the correct form with a non-zero direction vector. Therefore, the valid parameterizations are options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I've got this problem about parameterizing a line using vectors, and I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations. Let's take it step by step because I'm still getting the hang of this. \n\nFirst off, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form generally looks like this: \n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}$ is a point on the line, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the direction vector of the line. The parameter $t$ is a scalar that can take any real value. So, for each option, I need to check two things: is the point (given by the vector $\\mathbf{a}$) on the line, and is the direction vector (given by $\\mathbf{b}$) consistent with the line. \n\nWait, hold on. Actually, in the context of the problem, each of these seems to already provide the entire parameterization. So, perhaps the key thing here is to determine whether the given parameterization actually represents a line. Hmm. I guess that as long as the parameter is a scalar multiplied by the direction vector added to a specific point, it's a valid parameterization of the line passing through that point in the direction of the vector. So, maybe the only thing to check is that the point lies on the line, but since it's a parameterization, actually, I think it's more about ensuring that each component is linear in $t$.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, since each option is already in the form of a parameterization, maybe the question is whether it's correctly using vectors or if there's anything wrong with the form. For instance, does each component respect linearity in $t$? Or is there any issue with the direction vector being non-constant or something.\n\nWait, I think a parameterization of a line should have $x$ and $y$ each expressed as linear functions of a single parameter $t$. That is, each component is of the form $x = x_0 + at$ and $y = y_0 + bt$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants. So, if an option shows $x$ or $y$ as a non-linear function of $t$ or as a function of more than just $t$, that would be invalid.\n\nLooking at the options given, each one is in the form $x = x_0 + a t$ and $y = y_0 + b t$, which is exactly the form we need. So, perhaps I don't need to check for anything more complex? Maybe there's a different criterion.\n\nWait, no, actually, maybe for these options, I need to check if the direction vectors and the points are correctly associated with the lines.\n\nWait, the problem is just asking whether each option is a valid parameterization, not necessarily of a specific line. So, in that case, I think all of these options are valid parameterizations as long as each of them is in the form of a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. Since each option is presented in that form, they should all be valid. But that seems too straightforward. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"A line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo, each of these is a potential parameterization of some line. Since each one follows the correct structure of point plus scalar times direction vector, then they should all be valid. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because in multiple-choice questions like this, usually, they would have constraints or perhaps typos.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check whether the given point lies on the line defined by the direction vector? But how? Without a specific line to reference, that's impossible. Wait, unless there's some implicit line in the problem.\n\nWait, actually, if we are parameterizing a line, the direction vector should be consistent with the slope of the line. So, perhaps the direction vector should have components that correspond to the slope. For example, a direction vector of (a, b) should correspond to a slope of b/a. Maybe some of these options have direction vectors that make the slope undefined or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the direction vector shouldn't have any zero components, but that's not necessarily a rule.\n\nWait, actually, in two-dimensional space, direction vectors can have zero components, so as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it's fine. Similarly, points on the line can have any values.\n\nBut another thought: if the parameterization is written as a vector equation, each component must be a linear function of $t$. So, for each option, the components of $x$ and $y$ must be linear in $t$. For instance, if an option had $x = 2 + t^2$, that would be invalid because $t^2$ is quadratic, not linear. Similarly, if an option had $x = 3/t$, that would be invalid because of the division by $t$. But in the given options, I don't see any non-linear terms. All the components are linear in $t$.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nOption (A): $x = 4 - 3t$, $y = 1 -5t$ – linear.\n\nOption (B): $x = 17 +6t$, $y =5 +10t$ – linear.\n\nOption (C): $x =2 + (3/5)t$, $y = -7/3 + t$ – linear.\n\nOption (D): $x =14/5 + t$, $y = -1 + (3/5)t$ – linear.\n\nOption (E): $x =0 +15t$, $y = -17/3 -25t$ – linear.\n\nSo, all of them are linear in $t$, so from that perspective, each is a valid parameterization of a line. But maybe the question is expecting something more specific, like whether the direction vector is correctly aligned or the point is on the line.\n\nWait, the problem just says \"a line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So perhaps all are valid? But that seems too much because usually, in these questions, only some are correct. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether the direction vector is a scalar multiple of each other? Hmm. For instance, is each direction vector non-zero? Because if the direction vector is zero, then it's not a valid parameterization.\n\nLooking at the options, let me check each direction vector:\n\n(A) Direction vector: (-3, -5) – non-zero.\n\n(B) Direction vector: (6, 10) – non-zero.\n\n(C) Direction vector: (3/5, 1) – non-zero.\n\n(D) Direction vector: (1, 3/5) – non-zero.\n\n(E) Direction vector: (15, -25) – non-zero.\n\nSo, none of them have zero vectors, so that's fine. All direction vectors are valid.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the issue is with the point given. For each parameterization, the point must lie on the line it's supposed to parameterize. But without more information, how can we check if the point lies on a particular line? It's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is arbitrary, and any point can be a starting point. So, as long as you pick any point and a direction vector, it's a valid parameterization. Therefore, in that case, all of the options are valid because each gives a specific point and a direction vector.\n\nBut this seems too straightforward. The question mentions \"a line is to be parameterized using vectors,\" so maybe the line in question is given somewhere else, but since it's not, I can't know.\n\nWait, maybe in the original problem, it's an image or something that's not included here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each parameterization has to have the correct slope or something else. Let me think.\n\nWait, the slope of a line can be calculated as the ratio of the y-component to the x-component of the direction vector. So, for each option, the slope would be slope = (y-component)/(x-component). If the slope is consistent, then the direction vector is appropriate.\n\nBut without a specific slope given, we don't know if these are consistent. So maybe that's not the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a test of if the parameterizations are properly written as vectors, not in components. For example, if the parameter is misapplied or something.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n(A) A vector equals a point plus t times a direction vector. That seems correct.\n\n(B) Same structure.\n\n(C) Same structure.\n\n(D) Same structure.\n\n(E) Same structure.\n\nSo, all of them are in the correct format. So, perhaps all are valid.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the answer would be all of them. However, in the problem statement, it's specifying \"A line is to be parameterized using vectors,\" which might imply that each parameterization is of the same line? But without knowing the specific line, I can't tell. But the question is just asking which are valid parameterizations, period.\n\nSo, I think in that case, they are all valid because they're each in the correct form. So, points and direction vectors are given, and t is the parameter.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me recheck the parameterization of line equations because sometimes people use different notations.\n\nIn linear algebra, a parameterization is given by a point plus a scalar times a direction vector. So, each of these is exactly that. So, I can't see why any of them would be invalid. Each of them has an initial point (when t=0) and a direction vector.\n\nSo, in that case, I think all the options (A) through (E) are valid. Therefore, the correct answer is A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure because I remember sometimes that the direction vector should be non-zero, but they all have non-zero vectors. So, I think that's covered.\n\nWait, another thing: sometimes in some sources, parameterizations are required to have the direction vector in a specific way, but in this case, as long as they have a point on the line and a direction vector, it's valid.\n\nAlternatively, is there any issue with having a direction vector with zero components? For example, if the direction vector is (1, 0), that's fine, it's a horizontal line.\n\nIn option (C), the direction vector is (3/5, 1), which is fine because it's not vertical or horizontal, but just a slanted line.\n\nSimilarly, for (D), (1, 3/5) is also fine.\n\nIn (A), (-3, -5) is a direction vector with negative components.\n\nIn (B), (6, 10) is a direction vector with positive components.\n\nIn (E), (15, -25), which is also fine.\n\nSo, in all cases, direction vectors are non-zero and valid.\n\nIs there any other reason a parameterization would be invalid? Hmm, if a component was not linear in t, but as I saw earlier, all components are linear in t.\n\nTherefore, unless I'm missing some other rule, all the options are valid.\n\nWait, but just to confirm, sometimes people make errors by having direction vectors with fractions or something, but mathematically, that's still a direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the line is vertical or horizontal, you can't have a certain kind of parameterization, but with vector parameters, you can, by having a direction vector with 0 or infinite slope.\n\nBut in all these options, we have non-infinite and non-zero directions, so that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, after all that, I think that all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nSo, the answer should include all the letters: A, B, C, D, E.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, and \\boxed{E}.\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of a line, we need to check if each option follows the correct form of a parameterization. A parameterization of a line in vector form is generally given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}$ is a point on the line, $\\mathbf{b}$ is the direction vector, and $t$ is a parameter. \n\nWe need to ensure that each option:\n1.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations for a line. The parameterizations are all given in vector form, which is a bit different from the usual slope-intercept or point-slope form I'm more familiar with. Let me recall that a valid parameterization of a line in vector form should consist of a point on the line and a direction vector. \n\nThe general form is usually something like:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line (when \\(t=0\\)) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector, which gives the slope of the line.\n\nSo, for each option (A) through (E), I need to check two things:\n1. Is the starting point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) correctly giving a point on the line?\n2. Is the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) correctly providing a direction such that it forms a line with the given point?\n\nI think since all options are in the same format, I don't have to worry about different forms. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option (A):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nHere, the point is (4,1). If I plug \\(t=0\\), I get (4,1). The direction vector is (-3, -5). This seems valid. Since the direction vector is non-zero, and the point is specific, this should be a valid parameterization. So, I think option (A) is correct.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nSimilar structure. The point is (17,5) which is good, and direction vector is (6,10). Just like (A), this looks valid. So, (B) should also be correct.\n\nNow, option (C):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nAgain, a point is given as (2, -7/3). If I plug in \\(t=0\\), that's exactly the starting point. The direction vector is (3/5, 1). This also seems fine, because neither of the components is zero, which is acceptable for a direction vector. So, option (C) is valid.\n\nOption (D):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nPoint is (14/5, -1), which is a specific point, and the direction vector is (1, 3/5). The direction vector is non-zero, so this is a valid parameterization as well. Therefore, (D) is correct.\n\nFinally, option (E):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nPoint is (0, -17/3). Plugging in \\(t=0\\) gives that point. The direction vector is (15, -25). This seems okay too, because it's a non-zero vector, and it provides a direction for the line. So, (E) is valid.\n\nWait, hold on, let me think. Are all these direction vectors correct? Because sometimes direction vectors can be scaled, but in parameterizations, the direction vector can be any scalar multiple, right? So, (A)'s direction vector is (-3, -5), which can also be written as t*( -3, -5 ), but that's fine because t can be any real number.\n\nWait, actually, does the scaling matter? I think no, because t is a parameter, so scaling the direction vector would just change the speed at which you move along the line, but as long as the direction is maintained, it's still the same line. So, all direction vectors here are non-zero, so they are all valid. \n\nWait, but is there a catch? Maybe if the direction vector is zero, but none of these are. So, is there any reason to suspect these are invalid? I don't think so.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each of these is presented as a parameterization of a line. So as long as you have a point and a direction vector, it's a valid parameterization, regardless of where the point is. So, yeah, all of them seem to be okay.\n\nTherefore, after thinking it through, all options from (A) to (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, hold on, let me check if any of the direction vectors might have a problem when paired with the given point. Maybe for (C), the direction vector is (3/5,1), which has a different slope than something else, but that shouldn't matter because in a parameterization, any direction vector is acceptable as long as it's correct.\n\nWait, no, actually, a parameterization is just defined by the point and direction vector, regardless of whether it can be converted into slope-intercept or anything else. So, for example, if I have a direction vector, even if it's (a,b), it just represents the line with slope b/a, assuming a≠0.\n\nBut in option (C), the direction vector is (3/5,1), so the slope would be (1)/(3/5) = 5/3, which is fine. Similarly, option (B) has direction vector (6,10), which simplifies to slope 10/6=5/3. Option (D): (1, 3/5) has slope (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Option (E): direction vector (15, -25) has slope (-25)/15= -5/3.\n\nSo all these slopes are different but that doesn't make a problem, because a line can have multiple different parameterizations with different direction vectors, as long as they represent the same line. For example, a line can be represented with direction vector (a,b) or (-a,-b), because it just flips the direction of t.\n\nSo, as long as the direction vector is not zero, and the point is on the line when t=0, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nLooking back at each option:\n\n(A) Point (4,1), direction (-3,-5). When t varies, you get points like (4 - 3t, 1 -5t), which is correct.\n\n(B) Point (17,5), direction (6,10). Correct, same reasoning.\n\n(C) Point (2, -7/3), direction (3/5,1). Correct.\n\n(D) Point (14/5, -1), direction (1, 3/5). Correct.\n\n(E) Point (0, -17/3), direction (15, -25). Correct.\n\nHence, all of them are valid. But just to make sure, sometimes in these multiple choice problems, one might think, wait, is the direction vector required to be simplified or not? For example, sometimes people might say the direction vector shouldn't have common factors, but actually, direction vectors can have any components as long as they are non-zero.\n\nWait, actually, in some contexts, they prefer direction vectors to be in simplest terms, but since this is a parameterization, I think any scalar multiple is acceptable. So, for example, direction vector (15, -25) can also be written as 5*(3, -5), but since t can be any real number, it's still the same line.\n\nTherefore, all these are valid. Wait, so then the answer is A, B, C, D, E? But let me check if maybe one of them is actually invalid.\n\nWait, but hold on. In a parameterization, the point must lie on the line. But in this case, all these are starting points when t=0, so they lie on the line by definition. Therefore, all of them should be valid.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check one thing: the direction vector is not required to be a unit vector, so scaling is fine. So, unless there's something else, like specific constraints not mentioned here.\n\nI think that's it. So, actually, all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but wait, hold on, thinking again, since it's a line in 2D, you just need one point and a direction vector. The way the question is phrased, each option is a parameterization, so they are all valid as they have both a point and a direction vector.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these parameterizations (A to E) correctly represents the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, parameterizing a line usually involves a point on the line and a direction vector. The general form is r = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a point on the line and v is the direction vector.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a line given by y = mx + b, any point (x0, y0) that lies on the line must satisfy y0 = m*x0 + b. Also, the direction vector can be written as any scalar multiple of (1, m) since the slope is m.\n\nLooking at the given line, y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, m is 5/3. Therefore, the direction vector should be a scalar multiple of (1, 5/3). But sometimes, people like to write the direction vector without fractions, maybe as (3, 5) by multiplying both components by 3.\n\nSo, now I need to check each option to see if the point given lies on the line and if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (1, 5/3) or equivalent.\n\nStarting with option A:\n\nA) r = (4, 1) + t*(-3, -5)\n\nFirst, check if (4, 1) lies on the line. Plug x=4 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\nOh, so y=1 when x=4. That means (4,1) is on the line. Good.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (-3, -5). Is this a multiple of (1, 5/3)? Let's see. Let's compute the ratios. (-3)/(-5) = 3/5. And (1)/(5/3) = 3/5. So both components have the same ratio, 3/5, which means the direction vector is a scalar multiple. So, yes, this direction vector is valid.\n\nSo option A is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option B:\n\nB) r = (17, 5) + t*(6, 10)\n\nFirst, check if (17, 5) lies on the line. Plug x=17 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*17 - 17/3 = (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\n\nBut y is given as 5, which is 5 ≈ 15/3, which is nowhere near 68/3. So this point doesn't lie on the given line.\n\nBut hold on, do we even care? If the point isn't on the line, the entire parameterization won't lie on the line, so B is invalid.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Since the parameterization includes that specific point, if it's not on the line, then regardless of the direction vector, it's invalid. So yeah, B is out.\n\nOption C:\n\nC) r = (2, -7/3) + t*(3/5, 1)\n\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line. Plug x=2:\n\ny = (5/3)*2 - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = (-7)/3. So yes, y = -7/3 when x=2. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's see if this is a multiple of (1, 5/3). Let's find the ratio of the components:\n\n(3/5) / 1 = 3/5\n\nAnd 1 / (5/3) = 3/5\n\nSo the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (1, 5/3), with scalar 3/5.\n\nTherefore, C is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption D:\n\nD) r = (14/5, -1) + t*(1, 3/5)\n\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line. 14/5 is 2.8. Plug into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*(14/5) - 17/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5/3)*(14/5) = (14)/3, so y = 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1\n\nSo, yes, the point (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is (1, 3/5). Let's check if it's a multiple of (1, 5/3). Compute the ratios:\n\n1 / 1 = 1\n\n(3/5) / (5/3) = (9/25) ≈ 0.36\n\nBut 1 ≠ 9/25, so the ratios aren't equal. Therefore, this direction vector isn't a multiple of (1, 5/3). Hence, the parameterization is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculation:\n\n(3/5) divided by (5/3) is (3/5) * (3/5) = 9/25.\n\nAlternatively, if I see the components:\n\nDirection vector is (1, 3/5). For it to be a scalar multiple, the slope should be (3/5)/1 = 3/5, whereas the slope of the original line is 5/3. Since 3/5 ≠ 5/3, it's not a multiple. So yeah, D is invalid.\n\nOption E:\n\nE) r = (0, -17/3) + t*(15, -25)\n\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line. Plug x=0:\n\ny = (5/3)*0 - 17/3 = -17/3. So yes, the point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is (15, -25). Check if it's a multiple of (1, 5/3).\n\nLet me see: Let's divide both components by 15.\n\n15/15 = 1\n\n-25/15 = -5/3\n\nSo, direction vector is (1, -5/3). Hmm, the slope here is -5/3.\n\nBut the original line has a slope of 5/3, not -5/3. So unless it's a different line, this direction vector is not pointing in the same direction. Hence, E is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the direction vector (15, -25). The slope is -25/15 = -5/3, which is negative, whereas the line has a positive slope of 5/3. So, the direction is opposite. Hence, E doesn't represent the given line. Even though it starts on the line, it's going in the wrong direction.\n\nSo, compiling it all:\n\nA is valid.\n\nB is invalid.\n\nC is valid.\n\nD is invalid.\n\nE is invalid.\n\nSo, the correct options are A and C.\n\nBut let me just go back and check if I did E correctly. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nE's direction vector is (15, -25). Let's compute its slope. From x to y: rise over run is (-25)/15 = -5/3. The slope is negative, whereas the line's slope is positive. So, direction is opposite, so even if it starts on the line, it goes in a different direction. So yeah, E is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, A's direction vector: (-3, -5). From x to y: (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, so slope is 5/3, which matches the given line. And the point is on the line, so A is fine.\n\nC's direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's compute the slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, which is correct, and the starting point is on the line, so yes, C is good.\n\nD's direction vector is (1, 3/5). Slope: (3/5)/1 = 3/5 ≠ 5/3, so no. So yeah, D is invalid.\n\nSo, only A and C are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations correctly represent the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check if each given point lies on the line and if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of \\( \\left(1, \\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\).\n\n1. **Option A**:\n   - Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\)\n   - Direction vector: \\( (-3, -5) \\)\n   - Ratio: \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\)\n   - Valid: Yes\n\n2. **Option B**:\n   - Point: \\( (17, 5) \\)\n   - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\)\n   - Since \\( \\frac{68}{3} \\neq 5 \\), invalid.\n\n3. **Option C**:\n   - Point: \\( \\left(2, -\\frac{7}{3}\\right) \\)\n   - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\)\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}, 1\\right) \\)\n   - Ratio: \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{3}{5} \\)\n   - Valid: Yes\n\n4. **Option D**:\n   - Point: \\( \\left(\\frac{14}{5}, -1\\right) \\)\n   - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3} \\left(\\frac{14}{5}\\right) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -1 \\)\n   - Direction vector: \\( (1, \\frac{3}{5}) \\)\n   - Ratio: \\( \\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\neq \\frac{5}{3} \\)\n   - Invalid\n\n5. **Option E**:\n   - Point: \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\)\n   - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3} \\)\n   - Direction vector: \\( (15, -25) \\)\n   - Slope: \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\neq \\frac{5}{3} \\)\n   - Invalid\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A, C}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a vector parameterization of a line generally looks like this: \n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r_0} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{r_0}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector of the line.\n\nThe line given is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, any point (x, y) on this line should satisfy that equation. Therefore, in a parameterization, substituting the parametric equations for x and y should satisfy the equation of the line.\n\nNow, let's check each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nSo, parametric equations:\nx = 4 - 3t\ny = 1 - 5t\n\nWe need to see if y = (5/3)x -17/3 holds here. Let's plug x into the line equation and see if it gives y.\n\nCompute (5/3)x - 17/3:\n(5/3)(4 - 3t) - 17/3\n= (20/3 - 5t) - 17/3\n= (20/3 - 17/3) - 5t\n= (3/3) -5t\n= 1 -5t\n\nWhich is equal to y. So, option A is valid.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\nx = 17 + 6t\ny = 5 + 10t\n\nCheck if y = (5/3)x -17/3 holds.\n\nCompute (5/3)x -17/3:\n(5/3)(17 + 6t) -17/3\n= (85/3 + 10t) -17/3\n= (85/3 -17/3) +10t\n= 68/3 +10t\n\nNow, our y is 5 +10t, which is equal to 15/3 +10t. Comparing to 68/3 +10t, 15/3 is 5, but 68/3 is approximately 22.666... So, unless t is making 10t cover that, but the constants are different. Let's see, if 68/3 +10t equals 5 +10t, then 68/3 must equal 5. But 68/3 is about 22.666, which is not 5. Hence, this is not valid. So, option B is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.\n\n(5/3)(17 +6t) -17/3:\n= (5/3)(17) + (5/3)(6t) -17/3\n= (85/3) +10t -17/3\n= (85 -17)/3 +10t\n= 68/3 +10t\n\nAnd y from parameterization is 5 +10t = 15/3 +10t.\n\n68/3 is not equal to 15/3. So, unless 10t can be variable, but in this case, t is a scalar parameter. So, unless 10t -10t cancels out, which they don't here. So, since the constants don't match, it's invalid. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\nx = 2 + (3/5)t\ny = -7/3 + t\n\nCheck if y = (5/3)x -17/3 holds.\n\nCompute (5/3)x -17/3:\n(5/3)(2 + (3/5)t) -17/3\n= (10/3 + (15/15)t) -17/3\n= (10/3 -17/3) + t\n= (-7/3) + t\n\nWhich is exactly y. So, option C is valid.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\nx = 14/5 + t\ny = -1 + (3/5)t\n\nCheck if y = (5/3)x -17/3 holds.\n\nCompute (5/3)x -17/3:\n(5/3)(14/5 + t) -17/3\n= (14/3 + (5/3)t) -17/3\n= (14/3 -17/3) + (5/3)t\n= (-3/3) + (5/3)t\n= -1 + (5/3)t\n\nCompare this to the given y: -1 + (3/5)t\n\nWait, our computed y from the line is -1 + (5/3)t, but from parameterization it's -1 + (3/5)t. These are different unless t is adjusted, but since t is a scalar parameter, the direction vectors must be scalar multiples for the lines to be the same.\n\nCheck if direction vectors are scalar multiples:\n\nGiven direction vector is (1, 3/5). The computed slope is (5/3). So, the direction vector is (1, 3/5), which is slope 3/5.\n\nBut the line's slope is 5/3, so unless 3/5 = 5/3, which is not. 3/5 is 0.6, and 5/3 is approximately 1.666. So, slopes are different. Hence, the direction vector is not correct. Thus, D is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on. The direction vector in D is (1, 3/5). If we calculate the slope, it's (Δy)/(Δx) = (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But our line's slope is 5/3, so it's not the same. Therefore, direction is wrong. So, D is invalid.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\nx = 0 +15t\ny = -17/3 -25t\n\nCheck if y = (5/3)x -17/3 holds.\n\nCompute (5/3)x -17/3:\n(5/3)(15t) -17/3\n= 75t/3 -17/3\n= 25t -17/3\n\nCompare to given y: -17/3 -25t\n\nSo, 25t -17/3 vs. -25t -17/3. These are only equal if 25t = -25t, which implies t=0. But for all t, unless the coefficients are the same, it's not valid. So, unless 25t = -25t, which is only t=0, but the parameterization should satisfy for all t. Therefore, E is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, we can check slope as well. Direction vector is (15, -25). So slope is -25/15 = -5/3. Our line has slope 5/3. So, different slopes. So, invalid.\n\nWait, but let me check again because in the parameterization, the slope is -5/3, but the line's slope is 5/3, so they are negative reciprocals? No, reciprocal would be -3/5. Hmm, but I don't think that's relevant here because the slope of the line is fixed.\n\nSo, to represent the same line, the direction vector must be parallel to the line's direction, which is (1, 5/3). So, direction vector should be scalar multiple of (3,5), perhaps. But in E, direction vector is (15, -25), which is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). Alternatively, if we factor 5 out, it's 5*(3, -5), which is different. So, E is wrong.\n\nTherefore, after checking all options:\n\nA is valid because plugging in the parametrization satisfies the line equation.\n\nB is invalid because the constant terms don't match.\n\nC is valid because plugging in the parametrization satisfies the line equation.\n\nD is invalid because the direction vector has the wrong slope.\n\nE is invalid because the direction vector has the wrong slope and the constant term doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations correctly represent the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check each option by substituting the parametric equations into the line equation and verifying if they hold true.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\n\\( x = 4 - 3t \\)\n\\( y = 1 - 5t \\)\n\nSubstituting into the line equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3}(4 - 3t) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 - 5t\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{3} - 5t - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 - 5t\n\\]\nWhich is true, so A is valid.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\n\\( x = 17 + 6t \\)\n\\( y = 5 + 10t \\)\n\nSubstituting into the line equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3}(17 + 6t) - \\frac{17}{3} = 5 + 10t\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{68}{3} + 10t = \\frac{15}{3} + 10t\n\\]\nWhich is false, so B is invalid.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\n\\( x = 2 + \\frac{3}{5}t \\)\n\\( y = -7/3 + t \\)\n\nSubstituting into the line equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3}\\left(2 + \\frac{3}{5}t\\right) - \\frac{17}{3} = -7/3 + t\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{3} + t - \\frac{17}{3} = -7/3 + t\n\\]\nWhich is true, so C is valid.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\n\\( x = 14/5 + t \\)\n\\( y = -1 + \\frac{3}{5}t \\)\n\nSubstituting into the line equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3}\\left(\\frac{14}{5} + t\\right) - \\frac{17}{3} = -1 + \\frac{3}{5}t\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{3} + \\frac{5}{3}t - \\frac{17}{3} = -1 + \\frac{3}{5}t\n\\]\nWhich is false, so D is invalid.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nParametric equations:\n\\( x = 15t \\)\n\\( y = -17/3 - 25t \\)\n\nSubstituting into the line equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3}(15t) - \\frac{17}{3} = -17/3 - 25t\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n25t - \\frac{17}{3} = -17/3 - 25t\n\\]\nWhich is false, so E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A,C}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem here about parameterizing a line using vectors, and I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations. The missing condition is the line equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a vector parameterization of a line generally looks like this:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line (position vector) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector. The parameter \\(t\\) can be any real number.\n\nSo, for each option (A) through (E), I need to check two things:\n1. Does the point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) lie on the given line?\n2. Is the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) parallel to the line?\n\nIf both conditions are met, then that parameterization is valid.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if the point (4,1) is on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Plug in x=4:\n\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\nYes, the point (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The direction vector is (-3, -5). To see if it's parallel to the line, we need to see if it's a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector.\n\nThe given line is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The slope is 5/3, so the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 as well. Let's compute the slope of (-3, -5):\n\nSlope = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Perfect, it's the same as the line. So this direction vector is parallel.\n\nTherefore, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (17,5) is on the line.\n\nCalculate y = (5/3)(17) - 17/3.\n\nCompute (5/3)(17): 85/3 ≈ 28.333\n\nSubtract 17/3 ≈ 5.666: 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666\n\nBut the y-coordinate is 5, which is nowhere near 68/3. So, (17,5) is not on the line.\n\nSince the point isn't on the line, this parameterization isn't valid. So, option B is out.\n\n**Option C:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCheck if (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=2 into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = (-7)/3.\n\nYes, y = -7/3, so the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (3/5, 1). Compute its slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3.\n\nThe slope is 5/3, same as the line. So, direction vector is valid.\n\nTherefore, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nCompute y = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3.\n\nSimplify (5/3)(14/5): 14/3.\n\nSubtract 17/3: 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1.\n\nSo, y = -1, which matches the point. Good.\n\nNext, direction vector: (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5.\n\nBut our line has a slope of 5/3, which is not the same as 3/5. Wait, 3/5 is the reciprocal of 5/3, which means the direction vector is perpendicular to the line, not parallel. So, it's not a valid direction.\n\nTherefore, option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCheck if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=0 into y = (5/3)(0) -17/3 = 0 -17/3 = -17/3. So, yes, the point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector: (15, -25). Compute the slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nOur line has a slope of 5/3. The slope here is negative reciprocal. Since 5/3 and -5/3 are not the same, the direction vector isn't parallel to the line. Thus, this parameterization is not valid.\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, to be parallel, the direction vector just needs to have the same slope. But here, it's negative. So, they are not parallel, they're actually antiparallel, but in terms of direction vectors for lines, it's still parallel but pointing in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, actually, for lines, direction vectors can point in either direction as long as they have the same slope. So, the slope of the direction vector is -5/3, but the original line's slope is 5/3.\n\nSo, is that still parallel? Hmm, actually, parallel vectors can have opposite directions because parallelism for vectors just requires the same or exactly opposite direction. So, if the direction vector is a scalar multiple, even negative, it's still considered parallel.\n\nWait, but for lines, the direction vector just needs to have the same slope, regardless of direction. So, if direction vector's slope is 5/3 or -5/3, as long as the slope matches, but in this case, wait:\n\nWait, the direction vector in option E has a slope of (-25)/15 = -5/3, but the line has a slope of 5/3.\n\nSo, the direction vector is not parallel because its slope is different (negative reciprocal instead). So, actually, they are not parallel. Hence, direction vector is incorrect.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I confused something.\n\nWait, for two lines to be parallel, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples. So, if the direction vector is (a,b), then the slope is b/a. So, for the line, the slope is 5/3, so the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of (3,5). Let me check for option E: (15, -25). Is (15, -25) a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see.\n\nIf we divide each component of (15, -25) by 5, we get (3, -5). So, it's a scalar multiple of (3, -5), which is not the same as (3,5). So, (15, -25) is a scalar multiple of (3, -5), which has a slope of (-5)/3 = -5/3, which is different from 5/3. So, direction vector isn't parallel to the given line.\n\nTherefore, option E is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have direction vector (3,5) or (-3,-5), they are parallel. So, for the line with slope 5/3, the direction vector can be (3,5), (-3,-5), etc. But (15, -25) is (5*3, -5*5), which is (3, -5) scaled by 5. So, actually, the direction is (3, -5), which is not the same as (3,5). So, it's not a scalar multiple of (3,5); instead, it's a multiple of (3, -5). So, this would make it a direction vector with slope -5/3, which is not the same as 5/3.\n\nTherefore, the direction is not parallel. So, option E is invalid.\n\nSo, wrapping it up:\n\nValid options are A and C. Because both the point lies on the line and direction vectors are scalar multiples of the line's direction.\n\nWait, but hold on for option D, I initially thought it was invalid because the slope was 3/5 instead of 5/3. But maybe I should think in terms of direction vector scaling.\n\nIf I have direction vector (1, 3/5) in option D. Let me see if (1, 3/5) is a scalar multiple of (3,5). Multiply (1, 3/5) by 3, you get (3, 9/5), which is not (3,5). Similarly, if you try multiplying by 5, you get (5, 3), which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier about the slope. If direction vector (1, 3/5), the slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, whereas the line's slope is 5/3. So, unless 3/5 is a multiple of 5/3, which it isn't. 3/5 = k*(5/3), so k would have to be 9/25. But 9/25 isn't 1, so no. So, direction vector isn't parallel.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that direction vectors just need to have the same slope, but in different directions, it's okay.\n\nWait, no. Slope is rise over run. So, the direction vector (a, b) has a slope of b/a, so if slope is 5/3, then b/a should be 5/3. So, if (a, b) is parallel to the line, then b/a = 5/3. So, for direction vector in D: 3/5. Which is reciprocal.\n\nSo, if I have (3/5, 1) as a direction vector, slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, same as the line.\n\nWait, hold on. Direction vector (3/5, 1). Its slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. So, this is same as the line's slope.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nWait, direction vector is (3/5, 1). So, delta y is 1, delta x is 3/5.\n\nThus, slope is delta y / delta x = 1 / (3/5) = 5/3.\n\nSo, yeah, this is same as the slope of the line. So, (3/5,1) is a direction vector with slope 5/3, so it's parallel to the line.\n\nWait, then my initial conclusion about D was incorrect.\n\nBut in Option D, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). Let me check that. Delta y is 3/5, delta x is 1.\n\nThus, slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3. So, this slope is different.\n\nBut if direction vector was (3/5,1), then it's 5/3. So, as written, direction vector is (1, 3/5), slope is 3/5, which is different. So, it is not parallel. So, indeed, D is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only A and C are valid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check for option E. The direction vector is (15, -25). Slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3. The line's slope is 5/3, which is positive. So, unless negative reciprocal is considered, but here, the slope is negative. So, definitely, it's not parallel. So, direction vector is invalid.\n\nOkay, I think that's solid now.\n\nSo, conclusion: options A and C are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid options are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid, we need to check two conditions for each option: \n1. The point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) must lie on the line \\(y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3}\\).\n2. The direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) must be parallel to the line, meaning its slope must be \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\n**Option A:**\n- Point: \\((4, 1)\\)\n  - Check if on the line: \\(y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1\\). Yes.\n- Direction vector: \\((-3, -5)\\)\n  - Slope: \\(\\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\\). Yes, parallel.\n\n**Option B:**\n- Point: \\((17, 5)\\)\n  - Check if on the line: \\(y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} \\approx 22.666\\). No.\n\n**Option C:**\n- Point: \\((2, -\\frac{7}{3})\\)\n  - Check if on the line: \\(y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}\\). Yes.\n- Direction vector: \\((\\frac{3}{5}, 1)\\)\n  - Slope: \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{5}{3}\\). Yes, parallel.\n\n**Option D:**\n- Point: \\((\\frac{14}{5}, -1)\\)\n  - Check if on the line: \\(y = \\frac{5}{3}(\\frac{14}{5}) - \\frac{17}{3} = -1\\). Yes.\n- Direction vector: \\((1, \\frac{3}{5})\\)\n  - Slope: \\(\\frac{3/5}{1} = \\frac{3}{5}\\). No, not parallel.\n\n**Option E:**\n- Point: \\((0, -\\frac{17}{3})\\)\n  - Check if on the line: \\(y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3}\\). Yes.\n- Direction vector: \\((15, -25)\\)\n  - Slope: \\(\\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3}\\). No, not parallel.\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations correctly represent the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is usually given by a point on the line plus a direction vector multiplied by a parameter t. So each option (A) through (E) provides such an expression, and I need to check for each one whether it satisfies both the point on the line and the correct direction.\n\nFirst, let me note the given line equation: y = (5/3)x - 17/3. This is in slope-intercept form, which makes it easier to identify a point on the line because the y-intercept is when x=0. So plugging x=0, we get y = -17/3, so one point on the line is (0, -17/3). But wait, some of the parameterizations don't use this point. Hmm. Actually, each parameterization gives a specific point when t=0, so I should check if the given starting point is indeed on the line.\n\nSo for each option, when t=0, (x, y) should equal that point, and then the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 because the line's slope is 5/3.\n\nWait, actually, the direction vector isn't the slope, but the slope of the line should be equal to the ratio of the direction vector's components. So if the direction vector is <a, b>, then the slope should be b/a. Since our line's slope is 5/3, the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3, so the direction vector's y-component divided by the x-component should equal 5/3.\n\nSo for each option, I need to check two things:\n1. When t=0, does the point (x, y) lie on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3?\n2. Does the direction vector have a slope of 5/3, meaning that the direction vector's y-component divided by its x-component equals 5/3?\n\nAlso, note that in some cases, the direction vector might have integer components or be scaled versions, so we need to ensure that it reduces to the correct slope.\n\nAlright, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check the point when t=0: (4, 1). Does this lie on the line y = (5/3)x -17/3?\n\nPlugging x=4: y should be (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So yes, (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: < -3, -5 >.\n\nSlope is -5 / -3 = 5/3. Perfect, that's the required slope. So both conditions are satisfied. So option A is valid.\n\n**Option B:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAgain, check t=0 point (17,5). Does it lie on the line?\n\nCompute y = (5/3)(17) -17/3. Let's compute:\n\n(5/3)(17) = 85/3. Then 85/3 -17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.6667. But the y-component is 5, which is way different. So (17,5) is not on the line.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Since the parameterization must start at a point on the line when t=0, if that point isn't on the line, then the entire parameterization is wrong. So Option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check the point (2, -7/3). Does this lie on the line?\n\nCompute y = (5/3)(2) -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = -7/3. Yes, so (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: <3/5, 1>.\n\nSlope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. Perfect, that's the correct slope. So both conditions are satisfied. Option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCheck the point (14/5, -1). Does this lie on the line?\n\nCompute y = (5/3)(14/5) -17/3.\n\nSimplify: (5/3)(14/5) = 14/3.\n\nSo y = 14/3 -17/3 = -3/3 = -1. Yes, so (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nCheck the direction vector: <1, 3/5>.\n\nSlope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, that's 3/5, not 5/3. The given line has a slope of 5/3, so 3/5 is the reciprocal. That would mean the direction vector is incorrect because the slope is supposed to be 5/3.\n\nWait, let me double-check: The slope is rise over run, so if direction vector is <a, b>, slope is b/a. So if the direction vector is <1, 3/5>, then slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, which is not 5/3. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vector could be scaled? Let's see: If we have <1, 3/5>, multiplying numerator and denominator by 5 gives <5, 3>, which would have a slope of 3/5, which is still not 5/3.\n\nSo yes, the slope is incorrect. So Option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCheck the starting point (0, -17/3). When x=0, y should be -17/3, which is exactly what we have. So (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector <15, -25>.\n\nCompute slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nHmm, that's -5/3. The slope of the line is 5/3. The direction vector has slope -5/3, which is negative of the required slope.\n\nSo, that's a problem. Because the line is y = (5/3)x -17/3, which has a positive slope. So the direction vector should also have a positive slope. A direction vector with slope -5/3 would be going downward, but our line is going upward.\n\nSo even though the starting point is on the line, the direction is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe the direction vector is negative. That is, perhaps it's allowed because direction vectors can be scaled by any real number. If we take t to be positive or negative, we could go in either direction. But in this case, since the slope is negative in direction, but the line has positive slope, they are not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's see: direction vector is <15, -25>, so dy/dx is -25/15 = -5/3, correct. So the direction is downward, which is opposite to the line's slope of 5/3.\n\nTherefore, Option E's direction vector has the wrong slope. Therefore, Option E is invalid.\n\nSo to recap, for each option:\n- A: Starting point on line, correct slope. Valid.\n- B: Starting point not on line. Invalid.\n- C: Starting point on line, correct slope. Valid.\n- D: Starting point on line, but incorrect slope. Invalid.\n- E: Starting point on line, but incorrect slope. Invalid.\n\nHence, the valid parameterizations are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nWait, hold on, in the instructions, it says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So in the box, I should write A,C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represent the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two conditions for each option:\n1.

                "full_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem about parameterizing a line using vectors, and I need to figure out which of the given options are valid. The line is given as y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay, so I remember that a parameterization of a line requires two things: a point that lies on the line and a direction vector that's parallel to the line. \n\nLet me recall how parameterization works. A parameterized line is usually written as **r** = **p** + t**v**, where **p** is a specific point on the line, **v** is the direction vector, and t is a parameter. So, for each option, I need to check two things: does the point **p** satisfy the equation of the line, and is the direction vector **v** parallel to the line?\n\nThe line given is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. To find points on this line, I can plug in different x-values and compute the corresponding y-values. Alternatively, since some of the parameterizations give specific points, I can check if those points lie on the given line.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:** The parameterization is (x, y) = (4, 1) + t(-3, -5). First, let's check if (4, 1) lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Plugging in x = 4:\n\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. Yep, that's correct. So the point (4, 1) is on the line. \n\nNext, check the direction vector (-3, -5). The slope of this vector is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which is the same as the slope of the given line. That means the direction vector is indeed parallel to the line. So, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:** The parameterization is (17, 5) + t(6, 10). Let me check if (17, 5) is on the line. Plug in x = 17:\n\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3 = (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666. But the y-coordinate given is 5, which doesn't match 68/3. So, (17, 5) is not on the line. Therefore, option B is not a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, hold on, did I compute that correctly? Let me recalculate:\n\n(5/3)(17) is 85/3, which is approximately 28.333. Then subtracting 17/3 gives (85 - 17)/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666. Yeah, that's right. So 5 ≠ 22.666, so the point is not on the line. So B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:** The parameterization is (2, -7/3) + t(3/5, 1). First, let's check if (2, -7/3) is on the line. Plug in x = 2:\n\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = (-7)/3. So y = -7/3. That's exactly the y-coordinate given, so the point (2, -7/3) is on the line. Good.\n\nNext, check the direction vector (3/5, 1). The slope here is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, which is the same as the slope of the line. So the direction vector is parallel. Therefore, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:** The parameterization is (14/5, -1) + t(1, 3/5). Let me check the point first. x = 14/5, which is 2.8. Plugging into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - (17/3) = (-3)/3 = -1. So the y-coordinate is -1, which matches. So the point (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector (1, 3/5). The slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, which is different from the slope 5/3 of the given line. So the direction vector isn't parallel to the line. Therefore, even though the point is correct, the direction vector is incorrect. So option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but hold on: Maybe I made a mistake here? The slope is 3/5, which is actually reciprocal but not the same as 5/3? Wait, 5/3 is approximately 1.666, and 3/5 is 0.6, so they are reciprocals, but not the same. Therefore, the direction vector is not parallel. Thus, D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:** The parameterization is (0, -17/3) + t(15, -25). First, check the point (0, -17/3). Plug x = 0 into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(0) - 17/3 = 0 - 17/3 = -17/3. That's exactly the y-coordinate, so the point (0, -17/3) is on the line. Good.\n\nNext, direction vector (15, -25). The slope here is (-25)/15 = -5/3. The slope of the given line is 5/3, which is different. Also, the negative reciprocal is 3/5, but that's different. So, is (-25,15) parallel? Wait, actually, if we factor out, say, a scalar.\n\nLet me see: 15 divided by 5 is 3, and -25 divided by (-5) is 5. Wait, is there a scalar multiple? If we scale the direction vector (5, -5), that would give (25, -25), but E has (15, -25). No, that doesn't seem to be a scalar multiple. Let me see:\n\nSuppose there is a scalar k such that 15 = k*(5/3) and -25 = k*(-5). Let's solve:\n\nFrom the second component: -25 = k*(-5) ⇒ k = (-25)/(-5) = 5.\n\nThen from the first component: 15 = k*(5/3) = 5*(5/3) = 25/3 ≈ 8.333, which is not 15. Therefore, no scalar multiple, so the direction vector isn't parallel to the line. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nWait, but hold on. Alternatively, sometimes direction vectors can have different scalings as long as they point in the same or opposite direction, but in this case, it doesn't seem like it. So, I think my conclusion is correct that E is invalid.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- A: Valid\n- B: Invalid\n- C: Valid\n- D: Invalid\n- E: Invalid\n\nTherefore, the valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid options are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nSo, putting them together as letters separated by commas: A,C.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So in the final answer box, I need to write \\boxed{A,C}.\n\nYes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: whether the given point lies on the line and whether the direction vector is parallel to the line.\n\n**Option A:** The parameterization is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n- Point (4, 1) on the line: Substituting \\( x = 4 \\) gives \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The options are labeled (A) through (E), each giving a different vector equation. \n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line requires two things: a point that lies on the line and a direction vector that is parallel to the line. So, for each option, I should check two things: does the given point satisfy the equation of the line, and is the direction vector parallel to the line? If both are true, then that parameterization is valid.\n\nLet me start with option (A):\n\n**Option A:**\nPoint = (4, 1)\nDirection vector = (-3, -5)\n\nFirst, check if (4, 1) lies on the line y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nPlug x = 4 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(4) - 17/3\nCalculate that: (20/3) - (17/3) = 3/3 = 1. So y = 1. Perfect, the point (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector. The line has a slope of 5/3, which means the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 as well. The direction vector is (-3, -5). The slope is rise over run, so (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. That's correct, so the direction vector is indeed parallel to the line.\n\nTherefore, option A is valid.\n\n**Option B:**\nPoint = (17, 5)\nDirection vector = (6, 10)\n\nCheck if (17,5) is on the line.\n\nPlug x =17 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(17) -17/3.\n\nCalculate that: (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈22.6667. But the y-coordinate is given as 5, which is not equal to 68/3. So (17,5) is not on the line. Therefore, this parameterization is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems off. If the point isn't on the line, then regardless of the direction vector, the entire line wouldn't match. But just to be thorough, even if the point were on the line, we'd have to check the direction vector.\n\nSo, just for completion, let's check the direction vector's slope: 10/6 = 5/3. That's correct, but since the point isn't on the line, the parameterization is still invalid.\n\nSo, B is out.\n\n**Option C:**\nPoint = (2, -7/3)\nDirection vector = (3/5, 1)\n\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=2 into the line equation: y=(5/3)(2) -17/3\nCalculate that: 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3. So y = -7/3, which matches the given point. Good.\n\nNow check the direction vector: slope is 1/(3/5) = 5/3. Which is correct because the line has a slope of 5/3. Therefore, this parameterization is valid.\n\nSo, C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\nPoint = (14/5, -1)\nDirection vector = (1, 3/5)\n\nFirst, plug x=14/5 into the line equation: y=(5/3)(14/5) -17/3\n\nCalculate that:\n\n(5/3)(14/5) simplifies to (14/3). Then, subtract 17/3: 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So y=-1, which matches the given point. Good.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Hmm, the slope of the line is 5/3, which is different. So the direction vector is not parallel to the line. So this is invalid.\n\nWait, let me confirm: if a direction vector has components (a,b), then the slope is b/a. So (1, 3/5) has slope 3/5. The line has slope 5/3, which is the reciprocal. So they are not the same, meaning they aren't parallel. Hence, D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\nPoint = (0, -17/3)\nDirection vector = (15, -25)\n\nCheck if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=0 into the line equation: y=(5/3)(0) -17/3 = -17/3. So y=-17/3, which matches. Good.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3. Hmm, the original line has a slope of 5/3. Is a direction vector with slope -5/3 still parallel? I think direction vectors can have any slope, but it's just that for lines, the direction vector only needs to be a scalar multiple of the line's slope. However, in this case, the direction vector's slope is negative. But direction vectors can point in the opposite direction as long as they are scalar multiples.\n\nWait, if the direction vector's slope is -5/3, is that a multiple of 5/3? Yes, it's multiplied by -1. So effectively, (-15, 5) would be a scalar multiple, but here it's (15, -25). Let me check: (15, -25) is 15, -25. So to see if it's a multiple of (1, 5/3). \n\nIf direction vector is (a, b), then b = (5/3)a. Let's check: Is -25 = (5/3)(15)? (5/3)(15)=25. So no, because it's -25. Hence, it's not a scalar multiple. So the direction vector is not in the same direction, but opposite.\n\nWait, actually, direction vectors can be any scalar multiple, positive or negative. So as long as one is a scalar multiple, it's fine. But in this case, (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (1, 5/3), because if you take (1, 5/3), multiplying by 15 would give (15, 25), but here it's (15, -25). So that's not a scalar multiple. Hence, direction vector is not parallel.\n\nAlternatively, using another way: direction vector (15, -25). Let's see if it's a multiple of (3,5) which is from the slope 5/3. So, 15 is 5*3, 25 is 5*5. So, if it's (15, -25), it's 5*(3, -5). So, is (3, -5) parallel to (3,5)? No, because they have different directions. So, the direction vector isn't a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector. Hence, E is invalid.\n\nWait, let me confirm by calculating the direction vector's slope: slope is -25/15 = -5/3, and the line's slope is 5/3, so they are negative reciprocals, meaning they are perpendicular. Therefore, direction vector is perpendicular to the line, which means it's not parallel. So E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only options A and C are valid parameterizations of the line y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nWait, hold on. When I was evaluating E, I thought that direction vector (15, -25) is a multiple of (3, -5), which is a slope of -5/3. But the line's slope is 5/3, so negative reciprocal, meaning they are perpendicular. So, yeah, direction vector is not along the line.\n\nJust to recap:\n\nA: Point is on line, direction vector slope matches, so valid.\n\nB: Point is not on line, invalid.\n\nC: Point is on line, direction vector slope matches, valid.\n\nD: Point is on line, but direction vector slope is 3/5, which is not 5/3, so invalid.\n\nE: Point is on line, but direction vector slope is -5/3, which is not 5/3, so invalid.\n\nHence, only A and C are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct options are \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check if each given point lies on the line and if the direction vector is parallel to the line (i.e., has the same slope).\n\n**Option A:**\n- Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n- Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( (-3, -5) \\) has a slope of \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\)\n- Valid: Yes (point on line and slope matches)\n\n**Option B:**\n- Point: \\( (17, 5) \\)\n- Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\neq 5 \\)\n- Invalid: Point is not on the line\n\n**Option C:**\n- Point: \\( (2, -\\frac{7}{3}) \\)\n- Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( (\\frac{3}{5}, 1) \\) has a slope of \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\)\n- Valid: Yes (point on line and slope matches)\n\n**Option D:**\n- Point: \\( (\\frac{14}{5}, -1) \\)\n- Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(\\frac{14}{5}) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -1 \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( (1, \\frac{3}{5}) \\) has a slope of \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\)\n- Invalid: Slope does not match\n\n**Option E:**\n- Point: \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\)\n- Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( (15, -25) \\) has a slope of \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\)\n- Invalid: Slope does not match (negative reciprocal, not parallel)\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are \\(\\boxed{A}\\) and \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, let's recall that a parameterization of a line typically looks like r = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a point on the line and v is the direction vector.\n\nFirst, I should verify each option by checking if a point on the line is correctly given and if the direction vector is parallel to the line's direction.\n\nStarting with option (A):\nThe point given is (4, 1). Let's plug this into the line equation to see if it lies on the line.\n\nCalculating y = (5/3)*4 - 17/3.\n(5/3)*4 is 20/3, and subtracting 17/3 gives 3/3 which is 1. So yes, the point (4,1) lies on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector, which is (-3, -5). To see if it's parallel to the given line, we can check if it's a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector.\n\nThe line's slope is 5/3, so the direction vector should be something like (3, 5) or any scalar multiple. But here, the direction vector is (-3, -5), which is -1 times (3, 5). So, it's parallel but in the opposite direction. Since direction matters only in the sense of direction, not orientation, this is acceptable. So option (A) is valid.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\nThe point given is (17, 5). Plugging into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*17 - 17/3.\nCalculating (5/3)*17 = 85/3, then subtract 17/3 gives 68/3. But the y-coordinate is 5, which is 15/3. Since 68/3 is not equal to 15/3, the point (17,5) is not on the line. Therefore, option (B) is invalid.\n\nOption (C):\nThe point is (2, -7/3). Let's plug into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*2 - 17/3.\n(5/3)*2 = 10/3, subtract 17/3 gives (10 - 17)/3 = -7/3. So the point (2, -7/3) lies on the line.\n\nNow check the direction vector, which is (3/5, 1). The line's direction vector can be found from the slope: slope = 5/3, so a direction vector could be (3, 5). Is (3/5, 1) a scalar multiple of (3, 5)?\n\nLet me see: suppose (3/5, 1) = k*(3, 5).\n\nThen 3/5 = 3k => k = 1/5.\n\nThen 1 = 5k = 5*(1/5) = 1. It works. So the direction vector is (3/5,1) = (1/5)*(3,5), which is parallel to (3,5). So option (C) is valid.\n\nOption (D):\nThe point given is (14/5, -1). Plugging into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*(14/5) - 17/3.\nSimplify: (5/3)*(14/5) = 14/3, so 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So the point (14/5, -1) lies on the line.\n\nNext, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). Is this a scalar multiple of (3, 5)?\n\nLet's set up the equations:\n\n1 = 3k\n\n3/5 = 5k\n\nFrom the first equation, k = 1/3. Plugging into the second equation: 3/5 = 5*(1/3) = 5/3. But 3/5 is not equal to 5/3, so these vectors are not scalar multiples. Therefore, option (D) is invalid because the direction vector is not parallel to the line.\n\nOption (E):\nThe point is (0, -17/3). Plugging into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*0 - 17/3 = -17/3. So the point (0, -17/3) lies on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is (15, -25). Check if this is a scalar multiple of (3,5).\n\nSuppose (15, -25) = k*(3,5).\n\nSo 15 = 3k => k = 5.\n\nThen check the second component: 5k = 5*5 = 25, but the direction vector has -25. So it's -5*(3,5). Therefore, it's a scalar multiple, but with a negative sign. So the direction vector is opposite in direction, but still parallel.\n\nHence, option (E) is valid because the direction is parallel, even if the direction vector is negative.\n\nWait, but hold on. In the line equation, direction vectors can be any scalar multiple, positive or negative. So even if it's negative, it's still a valid direction vector for the line.\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\n(A) Valid\n\n(B) Invalid\n\n(C) Valid\n\n(D) Invalid\n\n(E) Valid\n\nSo the valid options are A, C, E.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A, C, and E. So the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{E}.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to enter the letters separated by commas inside one box. So, the final answer should be \\boxed{ACE}.\n\nWait, the initial instructions said: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, perhaps it's like \\boxed{A,C,E}. Hmm, depends on the format, but LaTeX can handle that.\n\nBut in the system, often multiple boxed answers are expected, but here the user said to \"Enter the final answer within \\boxed{}\", so I should probably write the answer as \\boxed{A,C,E}.\n\nBut let me check the options again.\n\nWait, in the problem, the direction vectors for (A) is (-3,-5). The line's direction is (3,5), so negative of that is still parallel.\n\nSimilarly, (E)'s direction vector is (15,-25). As per calculation, it's a multiple of (3,5) with a scalar of -5. So it's still parallel.\n\nSo all three, A, C, E are correct. Therefore, I think \\boxed{A,C,E} is the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure about option (D). The direction vector is (1, 3/5). If we multiply by 3, we get (3, 9/5). The slope is (9/5)/3 = 3/5, whereas the line has slope 5/3. So that's not parallel.\n\nWait, perhaps better to check by slope. For parameterization, slope is (delta y)/(delta x). For option (D): (delta y)/(delta x) = (3/5)/1 = 3/5. The line has slope 5/3. Since 3/5 ≠ 5/3, it's not parallel. Hence, (D) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly for option (E): delta y / delta x = (-25)/15 = -5/3. Wait, but the line is y = 5/3 x -17/3, which has positive slope. But slope of parameterization is -5/3, which is negative. However, slope is a direction. So, in parametric terms, direction vectors with negative slope can represent lines with positive or negative slope depending on how the direction is defined.\n\nWait, no. The direction vector's slope must match the line's slope. But actually, direction vector's slope is the same as the line's slope. So if the direction vector's slope is -5/3, then it's a line with slope -5/3, which is different from our line. So actually, in that case, the direction vector is not parallel to the given line. Wait, but if the direction vector is a scalar multiple, positive or negative, with the direction vector. So, for direction vector (15, -25) = 5*(3, -5). But the line's direction vector is (3,5). So these are not scalar multiples; they are not in the same or opposite directions. Therefore, my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's check.\n\nIn option (E), direction vector is (15, -25). Let's see if it's a scalar multiple of (3,5). So 15 = 3k => k = 5. Then y-component should be 5k = 25, but here it's -25. So, 5k = -25 => k = -5. So it's -5*(3,5) = (-15, -25). But the direction vector is (15, -25). So that is (15, -25) = -5*(3, -5). Hmm, so this direction vector is neither parallel nor anti-parallel to (3,5). Therefore, it's not parallel. So option (E) is actually invalid.\n\nWait, so that changes things. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.\n\nWait, how is that? Let's think about it.\n\nIf the direction vector is (3,5), then any scalar multiple (positive or negative) is considered parallel.\n\nSo, (3,5)*k, where k is any scalar, including negative.\n\nSo, if (15, -25) is a scalar multiple of (3,5), then it should be (3k,5k). But (15, -25) is (3k,5k) only if k =5 and k=-5, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, (15,-25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). So, direction vector (15,-25) is not parallel to the line. Therefore, option (E) is invalid.\n\nHence, my initial mistake was thinking that scalar multiples can be with any k, but in this case, it's not because one component gives k=5 and another k=-5, which are inconsistent.\n\nSo, this means option (E) is invalid. Therefore, only options A and C are correct.\n\nBut wait, let me recast this thought. If you have a direction vector, it doesn't matter about the sign, it just needs to have the same or opposite direction. But when it's a scalar multiple, it's about whether both components can be scaled by the same k.\n\nIn option (E), we have direction vector (15, -25). Let's see:\n\n15 = 3k and -25 = 5k.\n\nFrom 15=3k, k=5. Then plugging into the second equation: 5k=25, but we have -25. So, the same k doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, (15,-25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5), hence, not parallel. So option (E) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for option (D):\n\nDirection vector is (1, 3/5). So 1=3k and 3/5=5k.\n\nFrom first equation: k=1/3. Then second equation: 3/5 =5*(1/3)=5/3, which is not. So (1, 3/5) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5).\n\nHence, both (D) and (E) are invalid.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused. So initially, I thought (E) was valid, but upon closer examination, it's invalid because the direction vector isn't a scalar multiple of (3,5). So in that case, only (A) and (C) are valid.\n\nBut wait, let me check option (C). The direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's see if it's a scalar multiple.\n\n(3/5, 1) = k*(3,5). So 3/5=3k => k=1/5.\n\nThen, 1 = 5k = 5*(1/5)=1. Correct. So yes, direction vector is parallel.\n\nTherefore, only options (A) and (C) are valid.\n\nWait, but hang on, let's think about direction vector.\n\nGiven a direction vector (a,b), any scalar multiple (ka, kb) will produce a parallel vector.\n\nSo, for option (A), direction vector (-3, -5). So any multiple is acceptable. Since (-3, -5) = -1*(3,5). So direction is opposite, but still parallel.\n\nSimilarly, for option (C), (3/5, 1) = (1/5)*(3,5). So it's a scalar multiple, hence parallel.\n\nOption (E)'s direction vector is (15, -25). If you see, (15, -25) = 5*(3, -5). So (3, -5) is parallel to (3,5) with a negative y-component. But (3,-5) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5), because 3=3k, -5=5k => k=1 and k=-1, which is contradictory. So (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5), so invalid.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: Only options (A) and (C) are valid.\n\nBut I need to double-check.\n\nLet me re-examine all options:\n\n(A): Point is on the line, direction vector is parallel.\n\nYes.\n\n(B): Point not on the line, invalid.\n\n(C): Point on line, direction vector parallel.\n\nYes.\n\n(D): Point on line, direction vector not parallel.\n\nNo.\n\n(E): Point on line, direction vector not parallel.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify if (E) is truly not a scalar multiple.\n\nIs (15, -25) a scalar multiple of (3,5)?\n\nLet me solve 15 = 3k and -25 =5k.\n\nFirst equation: k=5.\n\nSecond equation: k=-5.\n\nSince k cannot be both 5 and -5 at the same time, no such scalar k exists. Therefore, no. Hence, (E) is invalid.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A and C.\n\nWait, let me check if perhaps there's a different way to interpret the problem. For example, sometimes parameterizations can have different representations but still be valid. Let me consider that.\n\nBut no, in general, direction vectors only need to be scalar multiples. So if they aren't, it's invalid.\n\nThus, only (A) and (C) are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C. So the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n\nWait, but the system might prefer a single box with the letters separated. So, perhaps \\boxed{A,C}.\n\nI'll check the initial problem. It says, \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, likely within one box.\n\nSo, to represent the final answer as the user requested, I should write the boxed letters separated by commas within a single box.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations correctly represent the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check if each given point lies on the line and if the direction vector is parallel to the line's direction vector (slope).\n\n1. **Option (A)**:\n   - Point: \\((4, 1)\\)\n   - Check if the point lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot 4 - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is given by a point on the line plus a direction vector multiplied by a parameter, usually t. So each option (A to E) provides a specific point (which is the position vector) and a direction vector.\n\nTo check if a parameterization is correct for a given line, I need to make sure two things:\n1. The point (when t=0) lies on the line.\n2. The direction vector is parallel to the line, meaning it has the same slope as the line.\n\nLet me start by finding the slope of the given line to compare with the direction vectors. The line is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The slope here is 5/3. So any direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 when simplified.\n\nNext, I'll go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nVector equation: (x, y) = (4, 1) + t(-3, -5)\n- The direction vector is (-3, -5). Let's find its slope: (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Okay, the slope matches.\n- Check if the point (4, 1) is on the line. Substitute x=4 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. Yes, (4,1) is on the line.\n- So Option A is valid.\n\n**Option B:**\nVector equation: (x, y) = (17, 5) + t(6, 10)\n- Direction vector: (6,10). Slope is 10/6 = 5/3. Good.\n- Check the point (17,5): Substitute x=17 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(17) - 17/3 = 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666... But the y-coordinate given is 5. 5 is approximately 15/3, which is not equal to 68/3. So the point is not on the line.\n- Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\nVector equation: (x, y) = (2, -7/3) + t(3/5, 1)\n- Direction vector: (3/5, 1). Let's find its slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. Correct slope.\n- Check the point (2, -7/3): Substitute x=2 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(2) -17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = -7/3. That's exactly the y-coordinate given. So the point is on the line.\n- So Option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\nVector equation: (x, y) = (14/5, -1) + t(1, 3/5)\n- Direction vector: (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, 3/5 is not equal to 5/3. That's a problem because the slope of the line is 5/3. So this direction vector is not parallel to the line.\n- Therefore, Option D is invalid regardless of the point.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can still check the point: x = 14/5 = 2.8. Then y should be (5/3)(14/5) -17/3 = (14/3) - (17/3) = (-3)/3 = -1. So y = -1, which matches the given point. But since the direction vector doesn't have the right slope, the parameterization isn't correct.\n\n**Option E:**\nVector equation: (x, y) = (0, -17/3) + t(15, -25)\n- Direction vector: (15, -25). Slope is -25/15 = -5/3. Hmm, that's the negative of the slope we need (which was 5/3). So the direction vector is not parallel; it's going in the opposite direction. So slope doesn't match.\n- Still, let's check the point: x=0, so y = (5/3)(0) -17/3 = -17/3. That's correct for the starting point. But because the slope is wrong, the entire parameterization isn't correct.\n\n**Summary:**\n- A: Valid\n- B: Invalid (wrong point)\n- C: Valid\n- D: Invalid (wrong direction vector)\n- E: Invalid (wrong direction vector)\n\nSo the correct options are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C, so the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n\nWait, actually, since I need to enter the letters separated by commas, I should present it as boxed letters. Let me adjust that.\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C} isn't standard. Usually, you can have multiple boxed answers or list them together. Since the question says to enter the letters separated by commas, perhaps inside a single box as A,C. Alternatively, the system might accept multiple boxes, but in the instructions, it says to put the final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nGiven that, maybe just \\boxed{AC} or \\boxed{A,C}. Let me check previous examples.\n\nLooking back, when multiple answers, they often do \\boxed{A} \\boxed{C}, but sometimes \\boxed{AC}. To be safe, as the user didn't specify, but in previous interactions, sometimes they are boxed separately, but here, as the options are letters, perhaps in a single box: A, C.\n\nAlternatively, as the original question lists the options with letters, so it might expect multiple boxed letters.\n\nBut to follow the instructions precisely: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nSo within the box, separated by commas, letters without any space. So it would be \\boxed{A,C}.\n\nI think that's acceptable. So the final answer is A and C, inside a box as A,C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: \n1.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations are valid. There are five options labeled (A) through (E). I know that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally written as:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{v}$\n\nWhere $\\mathbf{a}$ is a point on the line, and $\\mathbf{v}$ is the direction vector. For each option, I need to check two things: whether the given point $\\mathbf{a}$ lies on the line described by the parameterization and if the direction vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is consistent with the line's direction.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. Maybe I should think differently. The question is asking which parameterizations are valid, not to verify if they lie on a specific line. So each option is a different parameterization, possibly for any line. So perhaps I need to check if the direction vector is correctly scaled or if the point lies on a particular line. Hmm, no, the problem doesn't specify which line each parameterization is for. So perhaps all these are just different lines, each parameterized, and we need to just check if the format is correct.\n\nWait, no, the question says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors.\" So it's possible that each parameterization is for the same line, but that doesn't necessarily mean. Wait, maybe it's just asking which parameterizations are valid in terms of vector form, regardless of the line. But typically, any linear combination with a point on the line and a direction vector is a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, no. Maybe the problem is that all these options are supposed to be parameterizations of the same line, but it's not clear. Hmm, perhaps I need to interpret the problem correctly.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So it's a single line that needs to be parameterized, and these are different parameterizations of it. So I need to check for each option whether it correctly represents the same line.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether each option is a valid parameterization, regardless of which line. But all of them are parameterizations of lines. So perhaps the problem is just about whether each given equation is a correct parametric equation for a line in 2D, which generally it should be, provided that the direction vector is non-zero.\n\nWait, hold on. In vector form, any line can be written as a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So as long as the direction vector is not the zero vector, it's a valid parameterization. So perhaps all these options are valid, except maybe if the direction vector is zero? Let me check each direction vector.\n\nOption (A): direction vector is (-3, -5). Not zero, so valid.\n\nOption (B): direction vector is (6, 10). Not zero, so valid.\n\nOption (C): direction vector is (3/5, 1). Not zero, so valid.\n\nOption (D): direction vector is (1, 3/5). Not zero, so valid.\n\nOption (E): direction vector is (15, -25). Not zero, so valid.\n\nWait, so does that mean all of them are valid? Hmm, but sometimes, when a question says \"parameterized,\" it's not just about the format but also about direction or other properties. Maybe they are trying to test if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the actual direction. Because sometimes, parameterizations can be written with different scalars.\n\nWait, let me think. For a line, multiple parameterizations are possible as long as they represent the same line. So as long as the direction vectors are scalar multiples, it's just a matter of scaling the parameter t.\n\nSo for each parameterization, it is valid as long as the direction vector is non-zero, which they all are. But perhaps the issue is that the direction vector may not be consistent with the line's actual direction if the given line has a different slope.\n\nWait, hold on. Without knowing the original line, it's impossible to tell if the parameterizations are for the same line. The problem just says \"the line is to be parameterized,\" so perhaps each parameterization is for the same line, and the task is to figure out which are valid.\n\nBut that seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's just a straightforward question: each option is a parameterization, and we have to check which ones are correct.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. Since all these options are different parameterizations of a line, we have to see if they indeed describe the same line or different lines. If they're for the same line, then the direction vectors should be scalar multiples of each other and the points should lie on the same line.\n\nBut to do that, I need more information. Since each parameterization is different, they might represent different lines or the same line. It's not clear. Maybe the question is just asking which parameterizations are correctly written, i.e., have a non-zero direction vector, so all are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each parameterization is presented as a candidate for parameterizing a specific line, but the problem doesn't specify which line.\n\nWait, let me reread the question.\n\n\"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo it's a single line that needs to be parameterized, and the options are different ways of doing so. So we need to verify for each option whether it correctly parameterizes the same line. In that case, the parameterizations should correspond to the same line.\n\nTo check if two parameterizations are for the same line, we can see if one can be transformed into the other by scaling the parameter and/or translating the point.\n\nSo let's pick two parameterizations and see if they're for the same line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if all the parameterizations are for the same line, they should have direction vectors that are scalar multiples, and points lying on the same line.\n\nSo let's pick one parameterization and see if the others are equivalent.\n\nTake option (A): starting point (4,1), direction vector (-3,-5).\n\nLet me see what line this is. The parametric equations are x = 4 - 3t, y = 1 - 5t.\n\nSo from the parametric equations, we can eliminate t. From x: t = (4 - x)/3. Plug into y: y = 1 -5*(4 - x)/3 = 1 - (20 -5x)/3 = (3 -20 +5x)/3 = (-17 +5x)/3. So equation is y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nLet's see if the other parameterizations also result in this equation.\n\nOption (B): starting point (17,5), direction vector (6,10). So parametric equations: x =17 +6t, y=5 +10t.\n\nEliminate t: t=(x -17)/6. Plug into y: 5 +10*(x -17)/6 =5 + (10x -170)/6 = (30 +10x -170)/6 = (10x -140)/6 = (5x -70)/3. So y = (5/3)x -70/3.\n\nWait, that's a different equation. So option (B) would represent the line y=(5/3)x -70/3, which is different from option (A)'s line, y=(5/3)x -17/3. Therefore, options (A) and (B) parameterize different lines.\n\nSimilarly, check option (C): starting point (2, -7/3), direction vector (3/5,1).\n\nParametric equations: x =2 + (3/5)t, y= -7/3 + t.\n\nEliminate t: from x: t=5(x -2)/3. Plug into y: -7/3 +5(x -2)/3 = (-7 +5x -10)/3 = (5x -17)/3, so y= (5/3)x -17/3, which is the same as option (A). Therefore, option (C) is also parameterizing the same line as (A).\n\nOption (D): starting point (14/5, -1), direction vector (1, 3/5).\n\nParametric equations: x=14/5 + t, y= -1 + (3/5)t.\n\nEliminate t: from x: t =x -14/5. Plug into y: -1 + (3/5)(x -14/5)= -1 + (3/5)x - 42/25. Convert -1 to -25/25, so: (-25/25 -42/25) + (3/5)x = (-67/25) + (3/5)x. So y= (3/5)x -67/25.\n\nCompare with option (A): y= (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nHmm, are these the same? Let me check.\n\nMultiply both sides of option (D) by 15: 15y= 9x -67*3=9x -201.\n\nOption (A): Multiply by 3: 3y=5x -17. Multiply by 5: 15y=25x -85.\n\nSo 15y=9x -201 vs 15y=25x -85. These are different equations, so the slopes are different.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute the slope.\n\nOption (D): direction vector (1, 3/5). So the slope is (3/5)/1=3/5.\n\nOption (A): direction vector (-3,-5), slope is (-5)/(-3)=5/3.\n\nThese are different slopes, so the lines are different. Therefore, option (D) is parameterizing a different line, even though it might share the same equation if not for the calculation error.\n\nWait, let me double-check the elimination of t in option (D):\n\nx =14/5 + t\n\ny= -1 + (3/5)t\n\nSolve for t: t= x -14/5\n\nPlug into y:\n\ny= -1 + (3/5)(x -14/5)\n\n= -1 + (3x/5 -42/25)\n\n= (-25/25) + (15x/25 -42/25)\n\n= (15x -67)/25\n\nSo y= (15x -67)/25= (3/5)x -67/25\n\nYes, that's correct. And option (A) had y= (5/3)x -17/3. So the slopes are 5/3 vs. 3/5. So they're reciprocals, not negatives.\n\nSo different slopes, different lines.\n\nSo option (D) is a different line.\n\nNow check option (E): starting point (0, -17/3), direction vector (15, -25).\n\nParametric equations: x=0 +15t, y= -17/3 -25t.\n\nParametric equations: x=15t, y= -17/3 -25t.\n\nEliminate t: t= x/15.\n\nPlug into y: y= -17/3 -25*(x/15)= -17/3 - (25/15)x= -17/3 - (5/3)x= (-5/3)x -17/3.\n\nSo equation is y= (-5/3)x -17/3.\n\nCompare with option (A): y= (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nSo same y-intercept, but different slopes. So the lines are not the same, since they have different slopes.\n\nSo options (A), (C) are for the same line, others are different.\n\nBut wait, in option (C), starting point (2, -7/3) is on the same line as (A):\n\nFor option (A), when t=0, the point is (4,1). For option (C), t=0 gives (2, -7/3). Wait, but when t varies, does it ever reach (4,1)? Let's see. Let t be t1 in (C): 4=2 + (3/5)t1, so t1=(4-2)*(5/3)= (2)*(5/3)=10/3.\n\nSimilarly, y= -7/3 +10/3=3/3=1. So yes, when t=10/3, option (C) reaches (4,1). Therefore, (C) is just a parameterization starting from a different point on the same line. So yes, (C) is the same line.\n\nSimilarly, let's check option (E): If we take t in option (E) as t, and relate it to option (A).\n\nIn option (A), x=4 -3t, y=1 -5t.\n\nIn option (E), x=15t, y=-17/3 -25t.\n\nLet's see if these can be made to align.\n\nSuppose we let t = something in option (E) to reach a point on option (A). Let me solve for t so that x and y from (E) equal those from (A).\n\nSo set 15t_A =4 -3t_E\n\nand -17/3 -25t_E=1 -5t_A\n\nBut this is getting complicated, maybe a better approach is to see if the direction vectors are scalar multiples.\n\nOption (A) direction vector is (-3, -5). Option (E) direction vector is (15, -25).\n\nCheck if (15, -25)= k*(-3, -5). Let's see: 15= -3k =>k= -5. Then -25= -5k =>k=5. So inconsistency. Hence, direction vectors are not scalar multiples, so lines are different.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is a different line.\n\nSo conclusion: among the options, (A) and (C) are parameterizations of the same line y=(5/3)x -17/3, while (B), (D), (E) are parameterizations of different lines.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo if the line is fixed, only (A) and (C) would be valid if they're for the same line. Or if the problem allows for multiple parameterizations of the same line, then both (A) and (C) are valid.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether they need to parameterize the same specific line or different lines. So perhaps all of them are valid parameterizations for some line, since each has a non-zero direction vector.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking which are valid in the sense that they correctly represent a line without any mistakes. Which, as I thought earlier, all direction vectors are non-zero, so all are valid. But that seems contradictory, since (A) and (C) are parameterizations of the same line, but (B), (D), (E) are different.\n\nWait, the initial question is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nPossibly, if it's one line, which parameterizations are correct for that line. Since (A) and (C) are the same line, so (A) and (C) are valid. Others are different lines, so not parameterizing \"the line\" as in the original line.\n\nBut if the problem is testing whether all given parameterizations are valid (i.e., each is a correct parameterization of some line), then all are correct except perhaps ones where the direction vector is zero or not a vector in the plane. But all direction vectors here are in the plane and non-zero, so all are valid.\n\nWait, the key is that the problem says \"the line is to be parameterized.\" So it's not clear whether the parameterizations are for the same line or just some line. But in the answer, the options are given, and we need to select which are valid parameterizations. So each parameterization, regardless of the line, is valid as long as the direction vector is non-zero.\n\nSo unless the direction vector is zero, which none are, all are valid. So the answer would be all of them.\n\nBut in the initial analysis, we saw that (A) and (C) parameterize the same line, which is not different from option (E), but in any case, all have non-zero direction vectors.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that some parameterizations have direction vectors that are zero? Let me check:\n\n(A): (-3, -5) - non-zero\n\n(B): (6,10) - non-zero\n\n(C): (3/5,1) - non-zero\n\n(D): (1,3/5) - non-zero\n\n(E): (15,-25) - non-zero\n\nSo none of the direction vectors are zero. Therefore, all are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is looking for parameterizations in a different coordinate system, or that t is restricted to certain values? Or perhaps they need to have the same point when t=0? But unless specified, that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if \"the line\" refers to a specific line given in another part of the problem, which is not provided here, then (A) and (C) would be correct, but since the problem doesn't mention another line, we have to assume it's just about being a valid parameterization regardless of the line.\n\nBut given the original question is about being a parameterization of \"the line,\" and since we don't know the line, it's possible that each given parameterization could be for the same or different lines, but all are valid.\n\nHmm, I think my initial thought is perhaps incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some parameterizations use inconsistent scaling or point placement, but all are still valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a specific line, but since it's not given, all options are relative to different lines, and the question is whether each is a valid parameterization.\n\nSo, in that case, as direction vectors are non-zero, all are valid. But that contradicts the initial thought where only (A) and (C) are same.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about whether the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the line's actual direction. So for instance, if the line's direction vector is (a,b), then any scalar multiple (ka,kb) is also a valid direction vector.\n\nTherefore, even if (E) has a different direction vector, it's still",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations of a line using vectors. Hmm, parameterization of a line... I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is usually written as a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. The general form is:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}$,\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}$ is a specific point on the line, $\\mathbf{b}$ is the direction vector, and $t$ is a parameter that can take any real value.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to check two things: 1) that the given point $\\mathbf{a}$ is correctly specified, and 2) that the direction vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is correctly given. Both of these components are essential for a valid parameterization. If either the point or the direction vector is incorrect, then the parameterization is invalid.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nOkay, so here the point is (4,1) and the direction vector is (-3, -5). I don't see any immediate issues here. The point is a valid coordinate, and the direction vector is just a vector in the plane; it doesn't have to be a unit vector or anything. So, this seems like a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSimilarly, the point is (17,5) and the direction vector is (6,10). Again, both seem fine. I don't notice any red flags here either. The direction vector could also be simplified by dividing by 2, giving (3,5), but that doesn't affect the validity. So, Option B is also a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option C:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nHere, the point is (2, -7/3), which is a valid point, and the direction vector is (3/5, 1). Hmm, okay. But wait, sometimes people make mistakes with fractions, so let me double-check. Is the direction vector correctly specified? The x-component is 3/5, and y-component is 1. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think Option C is valid too.\n\n**Option D:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe point is (14/5, -1), which is a valid point, and the direction vector is (1, 3/5). That looks correct as well. I don't see any issues here, so Option D is also valid.\n\n**Option E:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe point here is (0, -17/3), and the direction vector is (15, -25). Hmm, I wonder if the direction vector can be simplified or if it's correctly oriented. Let me check if the direction vector is consistent with the point. Wait, but unless there's a specific line equation given that this parameterization should satisfy, I don't think so. Since the problem is only about the validity of the parameterization in terms of the vector form, and not whether it lies on a specific line or not, Option E is still valid. The point is given, the direction vector is given, both are correct. So, Option E is valid too.\n\nWait, hold on, am I missing something? Let me re-read the problem. It just says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" without any additional constraints or specific lines. Therefore, as long as each option is in the form point plus scalar times direction vector, they are all valid parameterizations, regardless of which specific line they represent.\n\nTherefore, looking at each option, all of them seem to follow the correct form. They all have a specific point and a direction vector. So, all options A through E are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? Because sometimes, in these multiple-choice questions, only some are correct. Let me re-examine each one in case I missed something.\n\nLooking back:\n\n**Option A:**\nPoint (4,1), direction (-3,-5). Correct.\n\n**Option B:**\nPoint (17,5), direction (6,10). Correct.\n\n**Option C:**\nPoint (2, -7/3), direction (3/5,1). Correct.\n\n**Option D:**\nPoint (14/5, -1), direction (1, 3/5). Correct.\n\n**Option E:**\nPoint (0, -17/3), direction (15, -25). Correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is the direction vector for Option E maybe aligned with the point?\n\nNo, because parameterization just needs the direction, not necessarily that the point lies on a specific line. So even if the direction vector is (15, -25), starting from (0, -17/3), that defines a valid line. So, no problem there.\n\nHmm, so actually, all of them seem valid. Is that really possible? Let me check another angle. Perhaps in terms of direction vectors or scalar multiples?\n\nWait, direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. So, Option A has direction (-3,-5), which is the same direction as (3,5) scaled by -1. Option B has (6,10), which is equivalent to (3,5) scaled by 2. Option C has (3/5,1), which is similar to (3,5) scaled by 1/5. Option D has (1, 3/5), similar to (5,3) scaled by 1/5. Option E has (15, -25), which is equivalent to (3, -5) scaled by 5.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't mean the direction vectors are incorrect; they can be any non-zero vector. So, in that sense, all are valid. So, does that mean all options are correct? Hmm, that seems so.\n\nWait, but sometimes problems expect parameterizations that are normalized or have integer components, but unless specified, any non-zero vector is a valid direction vector. So yes, they are all fine.\n\nBut hold on, just to make sure, perhaps direction vectors have to have integer components? I don't think so; direction vectors can be fractions or any real numbers. So, (3/5, 1) is fine, (1, 3/5) is fine, (15, -25) is fine, etc. So, the direction vectors are okay.\n\nTherefore, all five options are valid parameterizations. So, the answer would be A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut wait, let me check if perhaps Option E's direction vector is conflicting with the point. Like, maybe if plugging in t=0, you should get a point on a specific line? But unless told which line, it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when t=0, you get different points, but they still define different lines.\n\nWait, but without specific lines mentioned, the problem is only about the format of the parameterization. So, A to E are all valid. Hmm, so why am I second-guessing?\n\nWait, perhaps I should verify if all the direction vectors are non-zero. For instance, if any direction vector is the zero vector, that would be invalid. But in all cases here, each direction vector has either non-zero x or y components, so they are all valid.\n\nFor Option A: (-3,-5) - both components non-zero, okay.\n\nOption B: (6,10) - both non-zero, okay.\n\nOption C: (3/5, 1) - both non-zero, okay.\n\nOption D: (1, 3/5) - both non-zero, okay.\n\nOption E: (15, -25) - both non-zero, okay.\n\nSo, all direction vectors are valid, non-zero. So, all options A to E are valid parameterizations. So, the answer is all of them.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" and expects a comma-separated list.\n\nBut hold on, in the instructions, the user wrote:\n\n\"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nAnd before that, the problem is \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, perhaps the options are parameterizations of a specific line? Or is it just any line?\n\nWait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Is it asking for parameterizations of a specific line, or just any line? Because in the way it's worded, \"the line is to be parameterized...\", but the options are different parameterizations, so maybe all are valid parameterizations, regardless of which line they represent.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, maybe \"the line\" refers to a particular line, and the options are different parameterizations of that same line. But then, without knowing the equation of that line, we can't tell. Hmm.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. If \"the line\" is fixed, and we have to parameterize it, then we need to ensure that each parameterization indeed represents that specific line. So, let me check if that's the case.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each parameterization, we can check whether it represents the same line.\n\nSo, for that, we need to see whether the point given in the parameterization lies on the line, and whether the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector.\n\nBut hold on, in the problem statement, is there any information about \"the line\"? The problem is: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" Then the options are different parameterizations.\n\nWait, so maybe the line is arbitrary, and we just need to know if each parameterization is valid regardless of the line. So, the answer would still be all of them, because as long as the form is correct, they are valid.\n\nAlternatively, if \"the line\" is fixed and not mentioned, then all parameterizations are for the same line, so we need to see if each of these parameterizations actually represents that specific line.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention any specific line, perhaps we can assume that the line is arbitrary, so all parameterizations are valid.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check whether each parameterization, when defining a line, could be the same as another.\n\nWait, perhaps to clarify, the problem is just asking whether each parameterization is correctly structured, regardless of whether it's the same line. Therefore, all are valid.\n\nBut in case the line is fixed, then maybe each parameterization needs to pass through the point and have the correct direction.\n\nWait, but without knowing which line \"the line\" is, I can't tell.\n\nBut given the problem statement, it just says \"The line is to be parameterized...\", so I think they are separate parameterizations, not parameterizations of the same line. So, each one is on its own, thus all are valid.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all options A through E are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut in the initial options, I wonder if the problem is translated correctly, as sometimes that can cause confusion. The original problem was in Chinese, right? So, perhaps some nuances get lost in translation. But as given, the problem just says, \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, without more context, I think all options are valid.\n\nBut hold on, sometimes, people make the mistake that just because a parameterization is in the form of point plus t times vector, it's valid. But actually, both the point and the direction vector have to be correct with respect to the specific line, right?\n\nBut if \"the line\" is arbitrary, then I guess each parameterization is of a different line, so all are valid.\n\nAlternatively, if \"the line\" is fixed, say, as some specific line not mentioned here, then we need to check if the parameterization represents that line.\n\nWait, but given that it's not specified, the safest assumption is that all the options are of lines in general, without reference to a specific line, so all are valid.\n\nTherefore, A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut wait, I just need to confirm whether the problem requires the parameterization to be of a specific line or not. If \"the line\" is unspecified, then each option is a parameterization of its own line, so yes, all are valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is all letters: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut in the instructions, the user says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, if I have to write all, I think it's expected.\n\nBut just to be extra careful, maybe I should compute the direction vector for each parameterization and see if they are scalar multiples of each other or not, but actually, no, because each parameterization is independent.\n\nWait, no, each parameterization defines a line on its own. So, regardless of the direction vector, as long as it is written as a point plus a scalar times a vector, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nTherefore, all options are correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is that all options A, B, C, D, and E are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of a line using vectors, we need to check if each option is in the form of a specific point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. The general form is:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}$,\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}$ is a specific point on the line, $\\mathbf{b}$ is the direction vector, and $t$ is a parameter.\n\n**Option A:**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe point (4, 1) and the direction vector (-3, -5) are correct.

The options are labeled (A) through (E), and I have to check each one to see if they correctly represent a line in vector form.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a valid vector parameterization of a line looks like. In general, a parameterization of a line can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line (specific coordinates),\n- \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector of the line (direction in which the line extends),\n- \\(t\\) is a parameter that can take any real number value.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to check two things:\n1. Is the given point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) correctly positioned in the plane?\n2. Is the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) correctly giving the direction of the line?\n\nAlso, I should check if the parametric equations are consistent with a straight line, which they should be because direction vectors are constant.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nI don't see any immediate issues. The point (4,1) is a valid point on the line, and the direction vector has components that are real numbers, so that's fine. There's no reason why this wouldn't be a valid parameterization. So, I think (A) is valid.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nAgain, this looks correct. The point (17,5) is fine, and the direction vector is straightforward. The components are real numbers, so I don't see any problems here. Therefore, (B) should be valid.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nAgain, the components are real numbers, so direction vector is valid. The point (2, -7/3) is also a valid point on the line. Thus, (C) should be a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, let me double-check because sometimes there can be things like fractions or if the direction vector is scaled or something. But in this case, the components are fine, just fractional, but that's acceptable in a direction vector. So, yeah, (C) is valid.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nPoint is \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nEverything here seems fine too. The components are fractions, but that's okay. The direction vector is a valid vector in the plane. So, (D) is valid.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nI see that both components of the direction vector are integers, but that's totally fine. However, maybe I should check if this direction vector is a scalar multiple of another vector. But I don't think that's a problem; it just means that the line has a specific slope. The point is at (0, -17/3), which is on the y-axis. So, is this parameterization valid?\n\nWait, just thinking—does the parameter t have any restrictions? Since it can take any real value, including positive and negative, so yes, it's valid. The direction vector doesn't have to be a unit vector; it just defines the slope. So, since 15 and -25 are integers, and they don't require any scaling, this is still a valid parameterization. So, (E) should also be valid.\n\nHmm, so all of them are valid? That seems odd because sometimes people might make mistakes, like if the direction vector was a zero vector or if the point doesn't lie on the line, but here everything seems okay.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is there another possible issue that I might have missed? Let's think: sometimes in parametric equations, you can express lines in multiple ways, but as long as both the point and the direction vector are correct, it's fine. Since all these options have a point and a direction vector, and direction vectors aren't zero vectors unless they have zero components, which they are not here.\n\nBut in each of them, the direction vector is non-zero, so it should be fine. For example, in option (A), the direction vector is (-3, -5); that's a perfectly valid direction vector. Similarly, (B) has (6,10), (C) has (3/5,1), which is also valid, (D) has (1,3/5), and (E) has (15,-25). All non-zero direction vectors.\n\nTherefore, I think all of them are valid parameterizations. But wait, this seems a bit too many. The question is only asking which are valid. Let me make sure I didn't miss something.\n\nWait, perhaps, the original question says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors.\" Maybe there is more to it? Or perhaps it's referring to something else.\n\nBut no, in general, the standard parameterization is a point plus a direction vector times a scalar parameter, so as long as that is followed, it's fine.\n\nWait, maybe, in some cases, the direction vector can be scaled, but the equations still represent the same line. For example, direction vector (2,4) is the same line as (1,2) because they are scalar multiples. However, the parameterization would represent different lines because the parameter t would have different scalings, but in this case, all options have their own direction vectors.\n\nWait, but actually, no. If the direction vector is scaled by a scalar, the line is the same. However, in the problem, each parameterization is already in its own form, so the direction vector is as is. So, if someone gives you a line parameterized with a direction vector, as long as the direction vector isn't zero, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nTherefore, given that, all the given parameterizations are valid. However, maybe I need to consider something else. For instance, sometimes, if the direction vector is written incorrectly or if the point is incorrect in the context of the direction vector, but since we're given just the parameterization, each is valid on its own.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors.\" Maybe that is a bit unclear—does it mean that it's referring to a specific line, or any line? Because if it's a specific line, then maybe some of these parameterizations correspond to the same line, but I don't think that matters.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is miswritten or I misread it. Let me look again:\n\n\"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo, it doesn't specify a particular line, so any parameterization of a line is valid. So, each is a parameterization of some line, which is fine.\n\nSo, perhaps, all options (A) through (E) are valid. So, I think the answer is all of them: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\nBut in the initial problem statement, it was presented as a multiple-choice question with options (A) through (E), and it's asking which of the options are valid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each one in case I made a mistake.\n\nStarting again, let me verify each parameterization:\n\n**Option (A):**\n\nPoint is (4,1). Direction vector is (-3, -5). So, parametric equations:\n\nx = 4 - 3t\n\ny = 1 - 5t\n\nThis is a line; no issue. So, (A) is valid.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\nPoint is (17,5). Direction vector is (6,10). Parametric equations:\n\nx = 17 + 6t\n\ny = 5 + 10t\n\nThis is also a valid line. So, (B) is valid.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\nPoint is (2, -7/3). Direction vector is (3/5,1). So:\n\nx = 2 + (3/5)t\n\ny = -7/3 + t\n\nAgain, both components are defined, direction vector is non-zero. So, (C) is valid.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\nPoint is (14/5, -1). Direction vector is (1, 3/5). So:\n\nx = 14/5 + t\n\ny = -1 + (3/5)t\n\nEverything looks okay here. The point is fine, direction vector is non-zero. So, (D) is valid.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\nPoint is (0, -17/3). Direction vector is (15, -25). So:\n\nx = 0 + 15t\n\ny = -17/3 -25t\n\nThis is a line; t can be any real number, so yes, it's valid. So, (E) is valid.\n\nTherefore, all of them seem valid. So, the answer should be all options: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\nBut in some multiple-choice contexts, they sometimes trick you by having an invalid parameterization, but in this case, since each has a non-zero direction vector and a point, they are all valid.\n\nWait, hold on a second, but perhaps in some options, the direction vector might be such that it cannot be expressed as a direction vector because of fractions? But no, fractions are allowed in direction vectors. So, for example, (3/5, 1) is just a normal direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's something about the point? For example, is the point lying on the correct line? But since we aren't given a specific line, but just a generic parameterization, I think as long as the point is given and the direction vector is correct, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nTherefore, after double-checking, I think all of them are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations of a line are valid, we need to check if each option correctly represents a line in vector form.

                "full_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about parameterizing a line using vectors, and I need to figure out which of the options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what a parameterization of a line means.\n\nFrom my notes, a parameterization of a line in two dimensions generally looks like this:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a specific point on the line, and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) is the direction vector of the line. The variable \\(t\\) is a parameter that can take any real value. So, as \\(t\\) varies, the point \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\) moves along the line.\n\nAlright, so the key points to check for each option are:\n1. The given point \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a valid point on the line.\n2. The direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) correctly represents the direction of the line.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't state the specific line they are parameterizing. Hmm, that's odd. It just says \"the line\" and asks which are valid parameterizations. Maybe all these options are for the same line, or perhaps each one is supposed to be a different line's parameterization? Hmm, the question isn't entirely clear. But I think the main thing is to check if each parameterization correctly represents a line, which is done by ensuring that the point lies on the line and the direction vector is correct.\n\nWait, no—without knowing the specific line, it's impossible to know if the points and direction vectors are correct. Hmm. Maybe the question assumes that all these parameterizations are intended to represent the same line, and we have to verify if each one is correct for that line.\n\nBut since the problem says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors,\" perhaps each option is a candidate for parameterizing any line, and we need to verify that each is a valid parameterization of its own line, regardless of the original line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's saying that \"the line\" is some line, and the options are different parameterizations of it. Since it's not specified, perhaps the safest assumption is that each option is a possible parameterization of some line, and we just need to confirm whether each one is correctly formed as a line parameterization. So, the key is that each one should represent a line, which would require that they have a valid point and a valid direction vector. But I think that's given—they all have a point and a direction vector, so each is technically a line.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just testing whether each parameterization is correct in terms of the mathematical format, not necessarily about whether it's the same line or not. So as long as each parameterization follows the correct form, meaning that it's a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector, then all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. The problem is presented as if it's testing knowledge of parameterizations, so perhaps there is something more to it. Maybe the question is about whether the direction vectors are correctly scaled or if they lie on the line?\n\nWait, perhaps it's implied that all these options are parameterizing the same line, but different points and direction vectors. So to check validity, we need to see if they all represent the same line. That would make the problem more meaningful, as otherwise, all of them are valid, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to figure out if all these parameterizations correspond to the same line or not. If that's the case, then I have to see if they are scalar multiples of each other when it comes to the direction vector, and if the point lies on the line defined by another parameterization.\n\nBut without knowing the original line, I can't compare them. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, another thought: since it's asking which options are valid parameterizations, maybe some direction vectors are not consistent with the point given, or the point isn't lying on the line defined by another parameterization. So, for instance, if option A is given, is the point in option B on the line in A? That would test the validity.\n\nBut given that, maybe the user just needs to make sure that each parameterization is written in the correct form, i.e., point plus t times direction vector.\n\nBut wait, each one is of the correct form. So (A) is a point plus t times direction vector. Similarly for (B) through (E). So they are all line parameterizations.\n\nBut maybe the question is in the context of a specific line not given, so maybe all of them are correct, regardless.\n\nBut no, that can't be—since the user said to choose the correct ones from (A)-(E), which suggests that some are correct and some aren't. So, perhaps each parameterization is for a different line, but with some of them having direction vectors that can't be scaled to match each other, or points not lying on each other's lines.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps they are all parameterizations of the same line, but whether the direction vector is consistent with the others.\n\nFor example, to see if option (A) and (B) are both parameterizations of the same line, you can check if the direction vector in (A) is a scalar multiple of the direction vector in (B), and also check if the point in (A) lies on the line defined by (B) and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's test that idea.\n\nFirst, let's take option (A):\n\nPoint: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nOption (B): Point: \\(\\begin{pmatrix}17 \\\\5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix}6 \\\\10\\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nIs the direction vector of (B) a scalar multiple of (A)'s direction vector?\n\nCheck if \\(\\begin{pmatrix}6 \\\\10\\end{pmatrix}\\) is a multiple of \\(\\begin{pmatrix}-3\\\\-5\\end{pmatrix}\\). Let's see: 6 divided by -3 is -2, and 10 divided by -5 is -2. So yes, they are scalar multiples (multiplied by -2). So the direction vectors are consistent—they represent the same line.\n\nNow, does the point in (A) lie on the line in (B)? Let's check.\n\nThe line in (B) can be written as:\n\n\\(x = 17 + 6t\\)\n\n\\(y = 5 + 10t\\)\n\nLet's see if when \\(x = 4\\), \\(y = 1\\):\n\nSet \\(17 + 6t = 4\\). Then, \\(6t = -13\\), so \\(t = -13/6\\)\n\nThen, plug into y: \\(5 + 10*(-13/6) = 5 - 130/6 = 5 - 65/3 = (15 - 65)/3 = (-50)/3 ≈ -16.666\\), which is not 1.\n\nSo, the point (4,1) does not lie on the line defined by (B). Therefore, option (A) is not a valid parameterization of the line in (B). Wait, so perhaps (A) and (B) are both parameterizations of the same line, but (A) doesn't go through (4,1) on the line defined by (B). Hmm, that suggests that perhaps (A) is a different line, even though it shares the same direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're both parameterizing different lines that are parallel, since the direction vectors are scalar multiples. So, (A) and (B) are both parameterizing parallel lines.\n\nBut in any case, each parameterization is correct as a line, regardless. But if the question is whether they are correct parameterizations for the same line, then the answer is different. But the question is just asking which are valid parameterizations of \"the line\"—which is singular. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me reread the question: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nWait, maybe the line is a specific one, but since it's not given, it's impossible to know, so perhaps all options are valid?\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, it says \"the line is to be parameterized\", which suggests that it's a specific line, and the options are different parameterizations. So unless told which line, it's impossible.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the parameterizations being correct in general, but without a specific line, so all options are correct? That can't be—the way the problem is presented, with labels (A)-(E), suggests that they are supposed to be compared.\n\nWait, perhaps it's that some of these parameterizations do not correctly represent the same line, but since the original line isn't specified, each is a valid parameterization of their own line.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is all of them are valid, but that's probably not, because typically, when a question asks which parameterizations are correct, it's expecting you to check consistency if it's the same line or just validity.\n\nBut given that direction vectors are just multiples of each other (like option (A) and (B)) so they represent the same line direction, but different points, so different lines.\n\nBut without a given line, how can the options be invalid? Unless there's more context.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the points lying on the same line. Maybe \"the line\" refers to a specific one, and each parameterization is supposed to be for that one line. But without knowing the line, I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps it's that each parameterization is correct as a line, but only some of them pass through specific points, but again, without a specific line, all are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the answer is all of them are valid. But that doesn't make sense because in the way they're phrased, \"which of the following are valid parameterizations\"—so maybe some are incorrect.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each parameterization is of the same line, so they should all satisfy that the direction vector is a scalar multiple of each other and the points lie on the line.\n\nBut, as we saw earlier, (A) and (B) have direction vectors which are scalar multiples, so they are parallel lines. If the original line is, say, one specific line, but the parameterizations given in (A)-(E) could either be for the same line or not.\n\nWait, let me check the lines.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible that each is correct in terms of the direction vector, but not passing through the correct point.\n\nBut since without the specific line, I don't know.\n\nWait, but if the question is only about the parameterization being correct, regardless of the specific line, then all are correct.\n\nWait, but each parameterization is in the form point plus t times direction vector, so each is a valid parameterization for its own line, regardless of the point and direction vector. So, as such, each is valid.\n\nBut maybe the original problem was in a context where these parameterizations were meant to parameterize the same line, but if so, we need to check whether they are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a matter of being a linear parameterization without any constraints.\n\nWait, maybe the original line is given by something else, but it's not stated here.\n\nWait, the problem was: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo, it's just parameterizing a line, so as long as each is of the form point plus t times direction vector, they are valid.\n\nSo perhaps, since each is of that form, all are correct. Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. The problem wouldn't be asked that way, likely testing if the parameterization is correctly formed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each parameterization is different in points and direction vectors. So, perhaps all are correct? Because a line can be parameterized infinitely many ways, as any point on the line can be the starting point and any direction vector (up to scalar multiples) can be used.\n\nHence, unless there's some condition like passing through a specific point or having a specific direction, all parameterizations are correct.\n\nWait, but again, the question is \"which of the following options are valid parameterizations\", so unless it's about whether the direction vector is correct, but without knowing the line's slope or some point, it's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe all these parameterizations are valid, but let me double-check each one.\n\nOption (A):\n\nPoint (4,1), direction vector (-3,-5). So, the line is going from (4,1) in the direction of (-3,-5). That seems okay.\n\nOption (B):\n\nPoint (17,5), direction vector (6,10). The direction vector is 2*(3,5). Wait, 6 is 2*3, 10 is 2*5? Wait, 6 is 2*3, but 10 is 2*5, so the direction vector is (6,10). Yes, that's a scalar multiple of (3,5) scaled by 2. But wait, the direction vector in (A) is (-3,-5). Wait, so is (6,10) a scalar multiple of (-3,-5)? Let's see: 6 divided by -3 is -2, 10 divided by -5 is -2. So yes, (6,10) is -2*(-3,-5). So the direction vector in (B) is a scalar multiple of (A)'s direction vector. So, yes, the lines in (A) and (B) are the same.\n\nWait, so (A) and (B) are two parameterizations of the same line, because their direction vectors are scalar multiples and points lie on the same line.\n\nSo, both (A) and (B) are valid. Similarly, other options.\n\nWait, hold on, no. If (A) and (B) have direction vectors that are scalar multiples, and points (4,1) and (17,5) lie on the same line, then their parameterizations are for the same line.\n\nWait, actually, let me check if point (4,1) lies on the line defined by (B)'s parameterization.\n\nWait, to check if (4,1) is on the line defined by (B): parameterization is (17 +6t, 5 +10t). So, if we can find t such that:\n\n17 +6t = 4 and 5 +10t =1\n\nSo, 6t = 4 -17 = -13 => t = -13/6 ≈ -2.1667\n\nThen, plugging into the y-coordinate: 5 +10*(-13/6) = 5 - 130/6 = 5 - 21.6667 ≈ -16.6667 ≠ 1. So, it doesn't lie on the line.\n\nTherefore, point (4,1) is not on the line defined by (B), so (A) and (B) are not parameterizations of the same line. They are parallel lines but different.\n\nTherefore, in that case, each parameterization is of a different line.\n\nWait, but then again, the problem says \"the line is to be parameterized\". So, unless they are all parameterizing the same line, which they are not, as (A) and (B) aren't.\n\nHmm, so unless each is parameterizing a different line, in which case all of them are valid parameterizations of their respective lines, so all of them are valid. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think if they are lines with direction vectors and points, but for some of them, maybe the point does not lie on the line? Wait, but a parameterization by definition includes the point. So perhaps it's more about if the direction vector is correct for the line that the point is on.\n\nWait, unless, for example, if a line has a certain slope, and the parameterization's direction vector should reflect that slope.\n\nSo, for (A), direction vector (-3,-5) implies a slope of (-5)/(-3) = 5/3.\n\nFor (B), direction vector (6,10) implies a slope of 10/6 = 5/3. So same slope.\n\nFor (C), direction vector (3/5, 1) implies slope 1 / (3/5) = 5/3.\n\nFor (D), direction vector (1, 3/5) implies slope (3/5)/1 = 3/5, which is 0.6, but the slope from (A) is 5/3 ≈1.6667, so different.\n\nFor (E), direction vector (15, -25) implies slope -25/15 = -5/3, which is negative reciprocal, but different from the previous ones.\n\nWait a second, so each parameterization has a slope either 5/3, 3/5, or -5/3. So, unless the original line is specifically given to have one of these slopes, we can't know which ones are correct.\n\nWait, but without knowing the line's equation, it's impossible to determine which parameterizations are correct. Therefore, unless all of them are supposed to have the same slope, which is not the case.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that unless the original line is specified, each parameterization is valid, as each is correctly formed with a point and direction vector.\n\nBut the problem says \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, perhaps the intended question is whether each parameterization correctly represents a line, without considering the specific line.\n\nIn that case, each one is a valid parameterization, so all letters (A) through (E) would be correct. But I don't think that's the case because the way it's phrased, it's implying that some might be invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the direction vectors more carefully. Let me see if the direction vectors are non-zero vectors, which they all are. So, that's fine.\n\nBut perhaps the original line is not vertical or horizontal, so as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options A through E are valid parameterizations for a line. Hmm, I remember that a valid parameterization should represent a line in vector form. The general form is usually something like **r** = **r₀** + t**v**, where **r₀** is a point on the line and **v** is the direction vector. \n\nSo, each option gives me a point and a direction vector. I guess the question is whether the given point lies on the line and the direction vector is correct. Wait, no, actually, for a parameterization, as long as the point is on the line and the direction vector is correct, it should be fine. Hmm, but do I need to check anything else? Maybe the direction vector can be any scalar multiple of the actual direction vector, right? So, as long as the line is correctly defined, even if the direction vector is scaled, it's still a valid parameterization.\n\nBut wait, the line isn't specified here. So, does it matter which line we are parameterizing? The problem just says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors\" but doesn't specify which particular line. Hmm, maybe all these are supposed to be parameterizations for the same line? Or is each option a parameterization of some line without needing to relate to others?\n\nWait, reading the problem again: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, maybe each option is a different parameterization, and we need to determine which ones are valid for any line? Or is it about whether each is a correct parameterization in general?\n\nI think the key is to check whether each equation is a correct vector equation of a line, regardless of the specific line. So, a line in vector form is **r** = **a** + t**b**, where **a** is a point on the line, and **b** is the direction vector. There's no specific restriction on **a** or **b** except that they should define a straight line.\n\nSo, as long as each option is in the form of a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector, it's a valid parameterization. But maybe I should check whether the direction vector is non-zero and whether the point is correctly given?\n\nWait, but all the direction vectors given here are non-zero. Let me check:\n\nOption A: direction vector is (-3, -5). Not zero.\n\nOption B: direction vector is (6,10). Not zero.\n\nOption C: (3/5, 1). Not zero.\n\nOption D: (1, 3/5). Not zero.\n\nOption E: (15, -25). Not zero.\n\nSo, all direction vectors are non-zero, which is good because a direction vector must be non-zero to define a line.\n\nAlso, each equation is a point in R² plus t times a direction vector. So, each should represent a valid line parameterization.\n\nWait, then why is the question being asked? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific line, and we need to check if these parameterizations all lie on the same specific line. But the problem statement doesn't specify which line. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, perhaps \"the line\" is an arbitrary line in the plane, and we are to determine which of these vector equations correctly represent any line. Or maybe the line is fixed, and we are to check if each is a correct parameterization of that specific line.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is that all are valid parameterizations because each is of the form **r** = **a** + t**b**, which is the standard parameterization for a line.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Perhaps there's an implicit assumption here that these parameterizations are of the same line? Or maybe the problem was cut off, and \"the line\" refers to a specific line, but it's not given here.\n\nWait, the problem statement is only what's given above: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" Then the options follow.\n\nWait, maybe the line is arbitrary, so each of these forms is a valid parameterization for some line. But if the problem is asking whether each is a valid parameterization for a line, then yes, all are, because each is of the form **r** = **a** + t**b**.\n\nBut maybe the issue is with specific points or direction vectors? Like, in some cases, the direction vector might not be correctly associated with the line.\n\nWait, no. Without knowing the specific line, any equation in that form is a valid parameterization of some line, but not necessarily of a specific one.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that they might represent the same line, or different lines, but all are valid parameterizations for their respective lines.\n\nBut in the problem, the question is just about whether the parameterizations are valid, not whether they represent the same line. So, I think all are valid.\n\nWait, but that seems strange because usually in these questions, they test whether the direction vector is consistent with the line or something.\n\nWait, but perhaps, if the line is fixed, but the parameterizations use different points and direction vectors, then all would be valid. Alternatively, if the line is given, but it isn't here.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is about specific lines like x-axis or y-axis. But in the absence of that, I'm confused.\n\nWait, the user's problem statement is about a general line. So perhaps, unless the direction vector is zero or the point doesn't lie on the line, it's invalid. But without knowing the line, we can't check if the point lies on it. But wait, each parameterization uses a point and a direction vector, but unless the point is actually on the line in the problem, it would be invalid.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify what the line is, how can we know if each point is on the line?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is missing some context, like an equation of the line. Or maybe the question is a standalone, and we are to determine based on the given parameterizations.\n\nWait, perhaps each option is a parameterization of the same line. But without a reference, it's hard to check. Or maybe all of them are correct, because each is a valid vector equation for a line.\n\nBut perhaps they're all correct except those that have direction vectors not matching a possible line.\n\nWait, no, direction vectors can be any non-zero vector. So, as long as it's non-zero, it's valid.\n\nWait, I think maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since all the options are in the form of a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector, which is the standard parameterization of a line, then all of them are valid. So, A, B, C, D, E are all valid.\n\nBut that can't be right because the answer is just letters separated by commas, implying some are correct and others aren't.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the points given are supposed to lie on a specific line, which isn't provided, making each option invalid in context? Hmm, but if we don't have information about that line, we can't know.\n\nWait, unless it's about whether the direction vectors are scalar multiples. But no, direction vectors just need to be non-zero to define a line.\n\nWait, but maybe when plugging t=0, the points are supposed to be on some implicit line, which is not given.\n\nWait, unless each parameterization is invalid because it doesn't pass through a particular point? But without knowing the line, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is meant to be the same line, so some of these parameterizations might actually represent different lines with the same direction vector. But again, without the specific line, we can't say if they pass through a common point.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Each parameterization is for a different line, but all are correct in form.\n\nSo, perhaps each is a correct parameterization of a line because they are each in the form **r** = **a** + t**b**, where **b** is non-zero. So, A, B, C, D, E are all valid.\n\nWait, but since the answer requires letters separated by commas, and the instructions said \"enter the letters\", perhaps all are correct.\n\nBut the thing is, in multiple choice settings like this, sometimes options that can be simplified further or written differently might not be in the correct form.\n\nBut all options here are given in the standard form. Wait, unless they have direction vectors as zero, but they don't.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. Maybe some direction vectors have direction ratios that are inconsistent? Let me see. The direction vectors in each case:\n\nA: (-3, -5)\nB: (6,10)\nC: (3/5, 1)\nD: (1, 3/5)\nE: (15, -25)\n\nWait, I notice that in A, B, and E, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.\n\nA: (-3, -5)\n\nB: (6,10) which is -2 times A's vector.\n\nE: (15, -25) which is 5 times A's vector with a sign change, so actually E is -5 times A.\n\nSo, B and E are scalar multiples of A, so they're direction vectors for the same line if the point is appropriately adjusted.\n\nBut C and D are different. So, maybe C and D are different lines? But since all parameterizations are of lines, each is valid as long as they are in vector form.\n\nWait, unless the parameterizations require the same line, but since we don't have a specific line, each is independent.\n\nSo, maybe all of them are correct parameterizations of some line.\n\nBut why is the question specifically asking \"which of the following\" implying some are not? Maybe I need to think about whether each point is correctly chosen or something.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps some of these parameterizations don't pass through a common point if you set t=0 or something, but without knowing the specific line, we can't verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the point should lie on a specific line, which isn't given, so we can't know.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction vectors can be represented in the same form, so maybe they need to be written in a specific way, like fractions reduced or something.\n\nLooking at option C: direction vector (3/5, 1). Is that okay? It's in fraction form, but not necessarily invalid.\n\nOption D: direction vector (1, 3/5). That is also okay.\n\nOption E: direction vector (15, -25). Maybe they can be simplified by dividing by 5 to get (3, -5), which is the same direction as A.\n\nSo, all direction vectors are okay, just varying scalar multiples.\n\nTherefore, I think all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut the original problem says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors\", so maybe the line is fixed, and some of these parameterizations are of the same line, but with different points and direction vectors.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't specifying any line, so all parameterizations are of some line, so they are all valid.\n\nHence, all options A, B, C, D, E are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut since the user has said to enter letters separated by commas, but the standard might be that sometimes in such problems, direction vectors or points may not align correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the point lies on the line? But again, without knowing the line, can't confirm.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps when you solve for the line's equation from the parameterization, they might have to satisfy some constraints. For example, if you set t=1, does the point lie somewhere?\n\nBut without knowing the line, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if two different parameterizations are given for the same line, they can have different points and direction vectors.\n\nWait, but the question is just about parameterizations being valid, regardless of the line.\n\nWait, perhaps if you have to write the line equation in standard form, but in the absence of that, the parameterizations are fine.\n\nWait, maybe all are correct. But since the question is in Chinese, and sometimes in such problems, they expect you to check if direction vectors or the point is a solution.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each parameterization as defining a line, and each is a correct definition regardless of the specific line, because it's in vector form.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a mistake in the form, all are valid.\n\nHence, A, B, C, D, E are all correct.\n\nBut given that, why does the problem say \"which of the following are valid\", if they're all valid? So, probably the correct answer is all of them, but the way to represent that is with letters A,B,C,D,E. But in the answer, it's usually separated by commas.\n\nWait, but in the original instruction, the user wrote \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nSo, perhaps all are correct. So, enter A,B,C,D,E.\n\nBut in the initial answer, perhaps they might have a mistake.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, perhaps some of the direction vectors can be written as simplified forms. For example, D has a direction vector (1, 3/5). So, that can be written as (5, 3) if we clear denominators. Similarly, C: (3/5, 1) can be written as (3,5) if we clear denominators.\n\nBut I think in terms of being a direction vector, scaling is allowed. So, all these direction vectors are fine.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps some of the points don't lie on the line when you plug in a value of t, but since all parameterizations are of lines, as long as the direction vector is non-zero, the parameterization is valid, regardless of the point.\n\nSo, in that case, all options are valid.\n\nHence, the answer should be all letters A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut to confirm, if we take each option:\n\nOption A: Starts at (4,1) and goes in direction (-3,-5). This is a valid line.\n\nOption B: Starts at (17,5) and goes in direction (6,10), also a valid line.\n\nOption C: (2, -7/3) with direction (3/5,1). Valid.\n\nOption D: (14/5, -1) with direction (1, 3/5). Valid.\n\nOption E: (0, -17/3) with direction (15, -25). Valid.\n\nSo, yes, all are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n\nBut since the user instructions say to enter the letters separated by commas inside a single box, the final answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of a line, we need to check if each option is in the form of a vector equation of a line, which is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\). This form represents a line with a point \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and a direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nEach option is checked for the following:\n1. The point \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is given.\n2. The direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) is non-zero.\n\nAll options provided are in the correct vector form and have non-zero direction vectors. Therefore, all options are valid parameterizations of a line.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about parameterizing lines using vectors. There are five options labeled (A) through (E), and I need to figure out which ones are valid parameterizations. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a parameterization of a line in vector form looks like.\n\nI remember that a line can be described by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. In equation form, it's usually written as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a specific point on the line (position vector) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector of the line. The parameter \\(t\\) can be any real number, which scales the direction vector to get all the points on the line.\n\nSo, for each option (A) through (E), I need to check two things:\n1. Is the given point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) correctly positioned? That is, does the point lie on the line that we're supposed to represent? Wait, hold on, actually, I think the question just asks about the format, not the specific line. Hmm. Let me read it again.\n\nIt says, \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, I think it doesn't specify a particular line, so maybe each parameterization is just a line in the plane, regardless of its position. So, maybe all they need is that it's in the correct vector form, which is just the point plus a direction vector times a scalar.\n\nBut wait, actually, in some cases, maybe the direction vector might be incorrect if it's not consistent with a given line. But the problem doesn't provide specific lines, so I think the question is just about whether each option is a correct parameterization in general.\n\nBut just to be safe, maybe each option is a different line, and the question is which of them are correctly parameterized. So, perhaps the direction vectors are correct, and each line is represented by the correct point plus a direction vector.\n\nWait, without specific context, I think the key is that each option must have the correct form of a line parameterization. So, as long as they're written in the form \\(\\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{v}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a direction vector, then they're valid. So, in that case, maybe all options are valid, but perhaps some have issues with direction vectors that are zero vectors or something? No, direction vectors can't be zero vectors because that would mean the line is just a point.\n\nWait, looking at the options, none of them have direction vectors that are zero vectors. They all have direction vectors with non-zero components, so that shouldn't be a problem. So, maybe all are valid?\n\nWait, hold on, actually, the problem is to parameterize the line. So, if the line is just any line in the plane, and each option is a line, then the only thing that should be checked is whether the given parametric equation is a valid representation of some line.\n\nBut without the specific equations of the lines, perhaps I should think that maybe each option is correct. But that seems unlikely. So, maybe the question is about a given line, but the line isn't specified, so I might have to infer.\n\nWait, looking back, actually, the problem statement is just: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, maybe it's referring to a single specific line, and each option is a parameterization of that line? But without knowing what line, how can we know if the parameterizations are correct?\n\nWait, that might make sense. For example, if the line was given before the options, but here it's not. So, actually, maybe the options are general, and any line that can be parameterized in the vector form is valid, so as long as each option is in that vector form, they're all correct.\n\nBut that can't be, because the options are different, so maybe some are incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps, even more, perhaps each option is a different direction vector, so perhaps in the problem, if it was the same line each time, then their direction vectors should be scalar multiples, and points should lie on the same line.\n\nBut since the problem is given as it is, I don't know the original line, so perhaps we have to evaluate each option as a parameterization in general.\n\nWait, perhaps this is overcomplicating. Maybe the question is simply asking which of the given options are correctly written in the form of a vector equation for a line. So, regardless of their specific points and direction vectors, since each one is a vector equation of a line, they're all correct, just representing different lines.\n\nTherefore, all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Usually, these problems have some options that are incorrect, maybe because of the direction vector not being correct, or the point not being on the line.\n\nWait, now I think I need to think more carefully. Perhaps each option corresponds to a particular line, but we aren't given the equations of the lines, so we can't directly verify whether the points lie on them.\n\nBut, on second thought, maybe that's all that is required— the fact that the options are in the correct form.\n\nLet me recall: In vector form, a line is given by a point plus a scalar times a direction vector. So, any expression of that form is a valid parameterization of some line. So, as long as the format is correct, the direction vector is non-zero, and the point is given, then it's a valid parameterization.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n(A): A point (4,1) and a direction vector (-3,-5). Both are 2D vectors, so that's good.\n\n(B): Point (17,5) with direction vector (6,10). Again, 2D.\n\n(C): Point (2, -7/3) and direction vector (3/5,1). Okay, valid.\n\n(D): Point (14/5, -1) and direction vector (1, 3/5). Also valid.\n\n(E): Point (0, -17/3) with direction vector (15,-25). Valid as well.\n\nSo, assuming that the point and direction vector are given correctly and the direction vector isn't zero, which they aren't, each is a valid parameterization. So, all are correct.\n\nWait, but hang on, let's re-examine. Maybe in some systems, the direction vector isn't required to be in the simplest form, but technically, even so, it's still a valid parameterization. So, maybe all of them are correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said that it was parameterizing a specific line, then we could compare if each parameterization corresponds to that line by seeing if the direction vectors are scalar multiples and if a point lies on it. But since it's not, we can't do that here.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that all options are valid parameterizations because each is in the correct vector form with a point and a direction vector.\n\nWait, but actually, just to be thorough, maybe some have direction vectors that can be simplified or are equivalent.\n\nBut in general, direction vectors can be any non-zero vector, so even if they can be simplified, they're still valid direction vectors as long as they are not zero.\n\nSo, for example, option (E) has a direction vector (15,-25). That can be simplified by dividing by 5, giving (3,-5). So, it's a scalar multiple of option (A)'s direction vector.\n\nBut that doesn't make it invalid because direction vectors can be scaled.\n\nSimilarly, options (C) and (D): their direction vectors are (3/5,1) and (1, 3/5). Are these scalar multiples? Let's see.\n\nTake (3/5, 1) and (1, 3/5). If we multiply the first vector by 5/3, we get (1, 5/3), which is not the second vector. So, not scalar multiples. Similarly, other options: (B) has direction vector (6,10), which can be simplified by dividing by 2 to get (3,5). Option (A) has direction vector (-3,-5), which is just the negative of (3,5). So, that's a scalar multiple with a scalar of -1. So, (A) and (B) actually represent the same line but in opposite directions.\n\nSimilarly, (D) has a direction vector (1, 3/5). Let's see if that's a scalar multiple of any other direction vector. If we multiply it by 5, we get (5, 3). Is that a multiple of any other direction vector? Maybe (6,10) or (3,5). 5,3 and 6,10 aren't multiples. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe direction vectors can be any non-zero vectors, so the parametrization is fine. Therefore, all five options are valid parameterizations of some line.\n\nTherefore, all of them should be correct. So, the answer should include letters A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut just to make sure, is there any case where a direction vector is zero? Let me check:\n\n(A): (-3,-5) is non-zero.\n\n(B): (6,10) is non-zero.\n\n(C): (3/5,1) is non-zero.\n\n(D): (1, 3/5) is non-zero.\n\n(E): (15,-25) is non-zero.\n\nSo, all direction vectors are non-zero, so each is a valid line.\n\nAdditionally, all the points are in 2D, which matches the vector form given.\n\nTherefore, yes, all options are valid parameterizations of some line.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nAll options are valid. So, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}.\n\nWait, hold on. But according to instructions, I should enter the letters separated by commas within a single box.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these parameterizations are valid for a line. Hmm, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is usually given by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, in each option, we have a point vector and a direction vector multiplied by a parameter t. \n\nLet me recall that for a parameterization to be valid, two things need to be true: first, the point given should lie on the line when t=0, which it does in all cases because it's explicitly given as the starting point. So, that part is consistent for all options, so I don't have to worry about that.\n\nSecond, the direction vector should be consistent with the direction of the line. Wait, actually, in this problem, are we given specific lines? I think in the original problem, it's a bit ambiguous because the question is just about whether each given vector equation is a valid parameterization, not whether they represent the same line or not. So, as long as each equation represents a line, which they do because they have the form point plus t times direction vector, they are all valid parameterizations for some line. \n\nBut hold on, maybe the question is asking if each parameterization corresponds to the same specific line? If that's the case, then I would need to check if each line is the same. But the original problem just says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors,\" but doesn't specify which line. So, it might just be whether each is a valid parameterization for any line. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, I think the question is about whether each given parameterization correctly represents a line. Since all of them are in the form of point plus t times direction vector, they are all valid parameterizations for some line. So, maybe all of them are correct?\n\nBut that seems unlikely. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question is given a specific line, but I don't have information about that line, so it's impossible to tell? Hmm, no, maybe the parameterization is considered valid as long as the direction vector is correct or proportional, or something else?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the parameterizations must satisfy a certain condition, maybe passing through specific points or having a specific direction. But the problem statement is just asking if they are valid parameterizations. So, without additional constraints, I think each of them is a valid parameterization of some line. Therefore, all of the options A to E are valid.\n\nBut in the given options, they are labeled A to E, so the answer would be all of them. Wait, but that can't be because in the original question, it's given as multiple-choice, and the instructions say to enter the letters of the correct options, so maybe not all are correct.\n\nWait, maybe each parameterization has direction vectors that may not be direction vectors for some line? For example, if the direction vector is zero, then it wouldn't represent a line, but here all the direction vectors have components, so they're fine.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I need to check if the direction vectors are non-zero? Because if the direction vector is zero, the parameterization doesn't represent a line. In this case, all the direction vectors have non-zero components, so each parameterization is a valid line.\n\nBut, wait, let me think again. The problem says \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors.\" So, it might be that they are asking whether each given parameterization is a correct parameterization of the same line. If that's the case, then we need to see if each line is the same.\n\nWait, I need more information. But the original problem is as I stated, so it's ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nHmm. So, it's a bit unclear. If it's just about whether each equation represents a line, then yes, all are valid. But maybe they want each parameterization to pass through a specific point? For example, maybe the problem is about a specific line, not mentioned here. But since no specific line is given, I think the answer is that all are valid.\n\nBut in the problem, the user is saying, \"parameterized using vectors,\" maybe it's a translation or something else? Wait, in the original, it's given as vectors, so probably we don't have to worry about that.\n\nWait, another thought. Maybe if the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, they might represent the same line? For example, if one direction vector is a multiple of another, they could be the same line. But in our case, the direction vectors are different.\n\nBut without more information about the specific line, like a point it goes through or its slope, we can't compare. So, perhaps each is valid in the sense that it represents a line, not necessarily the same line.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is all of them.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check each option's direction vector and see if any are invalid. For instance, do any direction vectors have a component that's zero but the other component is not zero? That could complicate things, but in this case, all direction vectors have both components non-zero. So, I think they are all valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if each parameterization meets certain conditions, like the direction vectors are consistent with the standard parametrization. Wait, but a line can have infinitely many direction vectors, so as long as they are non-zero, they are acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to if each parameterization is consistent with a specific line, but since the specific line isn't given, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, is there another interpretation? Maybe the question is in Chinese, translated as \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" Maybe the user meant something else? Hmm, I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about whether each is a valid parametrization for any line, regardless of specific points. In that case, yes, all are correct because any point plus t times direction vector is a valid line.\n\nBut, again, without more context, it's unclear. Since the user didn't provide a specific line, I think the intended answer is that all options are valid.\n\nBut that might not be correct because, for example, in Chinese, \"the line\" could refer to a specific line, not just any line. Maybe each of the given parameterizations is for a specific line, and we have to see if they are valid. But without knowing the original line, it's impossible to tell if they parameterize the same line or not.\n\nWait, unless in the problem's original context, perhaps each is given in terms of slope, and we need to see if they have the same slope? But in the absence of the specific line's slope or equation, how can we compare the slopes?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction vectors can give the slope, so maybe I can compute the slope for each parameterization and see if it's consistent? For instance, the direction vector (a, b) gives a slope of b/a.\n\nSo, let's calculate slopes for each option:\n\nOption A: direction vector (-3, -5). Slope is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3.\n\nOption B: direction vector (6, 10). Slope is 10/6 = 5/3.\n\nOption C: direction vector (3/5, 1). Slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3.\n\nOption D: direction vector (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5.\n\nOption E: direction vector (15, -25). Slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nWait a second, so options A, B, and C have slope 5/3, D has slope 3/5, and E has slope -5/3.\n\nSo, if the original line has a specific slope, but since we don't know, maybe all options are valid parameterizations because each direction vector gives a non-zero slope, hence a line. But if the problem expects parameterizations that represent the same line, then only those with same slope. But again, without knowing the specific line, perhaps all options are valid.\n\nBut hold on, I think perhaps some of the parameterizations are not valid because they might pass through the same point or direction? But without knowing the specific line, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, they are asking which parameterizations are valid, given that they're parameterizing \"the line.\" So, if the same line is being parameterized, only those with the same direction vector (up to scalar multiples) and lying on the same point would be equivalent.\n\nBut without knowing the specific line, is there any way to know? I don't think so.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that each parameterization uses a different direction vector, but for the same line, direction vectors must be scalar multiples. For instance, slope is same if direction vectors are scalar multiples. So, since A, B, and C have same slope, they are scalar multiples of each other, so they could be parameterizations of the same line, provided they share a common point.\n\nBut again, since we don't know the specific line, we can't be sure.\n\nWait, but maybe all that matters is that each is a correct parameterization, regardless of whether they're for the same line. In that case, all are valid. So, perhaps the answer is all of them.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Wait, in the user instruction, they said \"the line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, maybe it's given that all options are parameterizations of that same line, but if so, they must all have the same direction vector. But we see that A, B, and C have the same slope, so direction vectors are scalar multiples. If they share a common point, they might be same line. Let's check.\n\nFor example, let's take option A: point (4,1). Option B: point (17,5). Option C: point (2, -7/3). So, they all have different points. If the direction vectors are the same or scalar multiples, but different starting points, then these are different lines.\n\nTherefore, unless they are all expressing the same line with different starting points, but since they have different direction vectors and starting points, each would represent a different line.\n\nWait, but in our previous calculation, A, B, and C have the same slope. So, unless they lie on the same line, but because their starting points are different, they can't be the same line. So, if the problem is to parameterize \"the line,\" then only those whose direction vectors are scalar multiples and pass through the same point are same line. Since all of them are for different starting points or have different direction vectors, they aren't same line.\n\nWait, so perhaps in that case, each of them is a different parameterization of different lines, all valid. So, as the question is about validity, meaning whether they're correct parameterizations of some line, then all are valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about which are correct in some other sense. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user didn't include an image or more context, so we can't figure that out. Given that, maybe the safest answer is all options are valid.\n\nBut, let me think again. Wait, sometimes in vector parameterizations, the direction vector can have direction but the initial point must lie on the line. If, for example, the problem is given with a specific line equation, you could check whether each point is on the line and whether direction vector is consistent. But since no line is given, perhaps the problem is simply about the parameterization being in the form point + t*direction vector. Which is always valid for any line, so all of them are valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is all of them: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider each in more depth.\n\nOption A:\n\nPoint (4,1), direction vector (-3,-5). So, any point on the line can be expressed as (4 - 3t, 1 - 5t). Let's see if this is a valid parameterization. Yes, for t=0, it's (4,1), and as t varies, it moves along the direction vector.\n\nSimilarly, Option B:\n\nPoint (17,5), direction vector (6,10). That is equivalent to (17 + 6t, 5 + 10t). That is valid.\n\nOption C:\n\nPoint (2, -7/3), direction vector (3/5, 1). So, the parametric equations are x = 2 + (3/5)t, y = -7/3 + t. That's valid.\n\nOption D:\n\nPoint (14/5, -1), direction vector (1, 3/5). So, x = 14/5 + t, y = -1 + (3/5)t. That seems valid.\n\nOption E:\n\nPoint (0, -17/3), direction vector (15, -25). So, x = 0 + 15t, y = -17/3 -25t. That's valid.\n\nWait, so each is a valid parameterization because they're all in the form point + t*direction vector. The only possible issue could be if the direction vector is zero, but all direction vectors here are non-zero, so they are all lines.\n\nTherefore, without more context, I think all options are correct.\n\nBut the original instruction in the problem says \"The line is to be parameterized using vectors. Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the line is a specific one, but if that's not given, all are valid. So, yeah, all.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. In case, for example, if direction vector is a zero vector, that's invalid, but here, none are zero.\n\nAlternatively, if the direction vector is non-zero but undefined, but direction vectors can't be undefined in this context.\n\nTherefore, I think all options are valid.\n\nWait, but just to confirm, let me see the points in each parameterization. So, for Option E, the initial point is (0, -17/3), and direction vector is (15, -25). So, when t = 0, it's at (0, -17/3). Let me see what slope is: direction vector (15, -25) gives slope of -25/15 = -5/3. So, if the line they are parameterizing is, for example, the line through (0, -17/3) with slope -5/3, then that's valid.\n\nSimilarly, Option D is at (14/5, -1), direction vector (1, 3/5), slope 3/5.\n\nSo, unless the specific line they're supposed to parameterize has a specific slope, but since that's not given, each parameterization is valid. So, all are valid.\n\nTherefore, answer is all of A, B, C, D, E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, and \\boxed{E}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations are valid, we need to check if each option is in the form of a point vector plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. This form is valid for any line, as long as the direction vector is non-zero.\n\n- **Option A**: The parameterization is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is valid because the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is non-zero.\n- **Option B**: The parameterization is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is valid because the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is non-zero.\n- **Option C**: The parameterization is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is valid because the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is non-zero.\n- **Option D**: The parameterization is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is valid because the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is non-zero.\n- **Option E**: The parameterization is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is valid because the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is non-zero.\n\nAll options are valid parameterizations because each represents a line in the form of a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. The direction vectors are all non-zero, ensuring that each parameterization is correct for some line.\n\n\\(\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\\)",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given options (A to E) are valid parameterizations of a line. Hmm, parameterizations... I think that means expressing the line in terms of a point and a direction vector. The general form is usually something like \\(\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t\\mathbf{v}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector.\n\nLet me check each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (A):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nSo the point here is (4,1), and the direction vector is (-3, -5). Since both are just numbers, that seems straightforward. Any direction vector is acceptable as long as it's consistent, so this looks valid.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nPoint is (17,5), direction vector is (6,10). I don't see any issues here either. The direction vector is fine; it doesn't have to be a unit vector or anything. So (B) is valid.\n\nNow option (C):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nPoint is (2, -7/3), direction vector is (3/5,1). Hmm, I don't think there's anything wrong with fractional components. Direction vectors can have fractions. So, (C) seems valid too.\n\nLooking at option (D):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nPoint is (14/5, -1), direction vector is (1, 3/5). Same reasoning as before, fractions are okay. So (D) is valid.\n\nNow, option (E):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nPoint is (0, -17/3), direction vector is (15, -25). Wait, let me see if the direction vector is correct. Direction vectors just indicate the slope, right? So, direction vectors can be scaled by any scalar. Let me check if 15 and -25 are consistent with the point.\n\nBut wait, the issue is whether the point (0, -17/3) lies on the line defined by the parametrization. Wait, no, the point is just any point on the line. So the line will pass through (0, -17/3) and extend in the direction of (15, -25). Since 15 and -25 are just numbers, it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the direction vector can be simplified or not. 15 and -25 can both be divided by 5, so the direction vector is 5*(3, -5). So it's just a scalar multiple, which is fine. So the parameterization is still valid.\n\nWait, maybe another check: direction vector is (15, -25), point is (0, -17/3). Let's see if the point (0, -17/3) can be obtained when t=0. Yes, because when t=0, we get the point. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the parametrization is correct, but perhaps the direction vector could be simplified? I don't think that affects validity. So (E) is valid.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think if I misread the question. It asks for valid parameterizations, which are expressions in terms of vectors for a line. So, as long as the point is on the line and the direction vector is consistent, which all of them seem to be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test each parametrization by plugging in t=0 or t=1 to see if the line seems to be consistent.\n\nFor (A): when t=0, we get (4,1). So the line passes through (4,1) and direction vector (-3,-5). Makes sense.\n\n(B): t=0 gives (17,5). Direction vector (6,10). That's a line going through (17,5) with a slope of 10/6=5/3. Fine.\n\n(C): t=0 is (2, -7/3). Direction vector (3/5,1). Slope is 1 / (3/5)=5/3. Same as (B). So it's a line with slope 5/3 passing through (2, -7/3). That's valid.\n\n(D): t=0 is (14/5, -1). Direction vector (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1=3/5. So the line has a slope of 3/5, which is different from the others. But that's fine, parameterizations can have different slopes as long as they are lines.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. Each option is a separate line? Or is the question parameterizing the same line? Wait, no. Each option is a different parameterization of a line in the plane. So each one is a different line, given different points and direction vectors. So if any of them is a valid parameterization for their respective line, then they are valid, regardless of other lines.\n\nBut the question is asking which of these options are valid parameterizations. So each of them is a parameterization of a different line. So each one is valid, as they all have a point and a direction vector.\n\nWait, but is that really the case? Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. When a line is parameterized, different parameterizations can represent the same line. But here, each option is a different parameterization, each representing different lines. So as long as the direction vector is consistent for the line they're supposed to represent, which is given the point. Wait, but maybe the direction vector is not consistent? For example, in (E), the direction vector is (15, -25). So, is that a direction vector?\n\nYes, (15, -25) is a direction vector for the line, regardless of the point. Similarly, all the others have direction vectors, so each of these is a valid parameterization of some line.\n\nWait, but the question didn't specify whether they are parameterizing the same line or different lines. It just says \"which of the following options are valid parameterizations.\"\n\nSo, a parameterization is valid if it's of the form point plus t times direction vector. So, all these options are parameterizations, regardless of the specific line. So, is that all of them are valid?\n\nBut that can't be, since sometimes people may make mistakes with points not being consistent with the direction vector or direction vectors being zero vectors or something. But here, all direction vectors are non-zero, and points are given.\n\nWait, but maybe in option (C), the direction vector is (3/5,1). Is 3/5 a decimal or fraction? But that's fine, fractions are okay in parameterizations.\n\nSimilarly, option (E) has direction vector (15, -25). They can have different scales, as direction vectors can be scaled.\n\nTherefore, maybe all options are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut in the question, it's phrased as \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So probably, the answer is all of them, but wait, let's see.\n\nWait, but sometimes people may think a parameterization is invalid if the direction vector is zero, but here direction vectors are not zero. So, but in the problem, the parameterization is given, so as long as it's in the form of point plus t times direction vector, which all of them are.\n\nWait, unless the direction vector is written as a zero vector, but none of them is.\n\nSo, perhaps all of them are valid. So, the answer is A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut that seems too easy, but maybe that's the case.\n\nWait, but maybe when solving for the line equation, some may result in different lines? Wait, no, parameterizations are different ways to write the same or different lines.\n\nSo, unless there's a typo in the direction vectors or something, I don't see why any of them would be invalid.\n\nWait, maybe in option (C), when I look at the direction vector, the components are (3/5,1). So, is that a valid direction vector? Yeah, for example, if you have dy/dx=5/3, because (3/5,1) corresponds to slope of 1/(3/5)=5/3.\n\nBut is that direction vector acceptable? I don't think so, wait, direction vector's slope should correspond. So, the direction vector (a,b) has a slope of b/a. So, if the direction vector is (3/5,1), then slope is 1/(3/5)=5/3, as I said earlier. So, that seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, option (E) has direction vector (15, -25), which is a slope of -25/15=-5/3. Which is also a valid slope.\n\nSo, I don't see why any of them would be invalid. Therefore, all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut the problem is from a math problem set, so maybe there is a trick. Perhaps in some of them, the direction vector is zero or the point isn't on the line?\n\nWait, but in each case, the point is just given. There's no verification that the point lies on a particular line, unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that the direction vector must match the slope from a previous question? But the original problem didn't specify any specific line. Hmm.\n\nWait, in that case, maybe all of them are correct.\n\nBut the original instruction was just to parameterize the line, and each of them is parameterized as point plus t times direction vector, which is a standard form, so I think they're all valid.\n\nBut let me think differently: maybe some options have direction vectors that are zero vectors? For example, if a direction vector had all components zero, that would be invalid, because you can't have a zero direction vector. But none of the options have all components zero. All direction vectors have non-zero components, so that's not the issue.\n\nAnother thought: when dealing with parameterizations, some may have redundant points or direction vectors, but as long as it's in the form point plus t times direction vector, it's okay.\n\nWait, another possible issue is if the direction vector is written as a scalar multiple of the direction vector for another line. But since each line here is parameterized separately, it's not relevant. So, each one is valid.\n\nTherefore, after this lengthy thinking, I believe all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid options are \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, and \\boxed{E}.\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations, we need to check if each option is in the form \\(\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t\\mathbf{v}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector.\n\n- **Option (A)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n  The point \\((4, 1)\\) and the direction vector \\((-3, -5)\\) are valid.

The line is supposed to satisfy the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally given by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So each option (A to E) is a different vector equation. To determine if a parameterization is valid, I think I need to check two things for each option:\n\n1. Does the given point (when t=0) lie on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3?\n2. Is the direction vector parallel to the given line? That means the direction vector should have the same slope as the line.\n\nLet me write that down more formally.\n\nFor each option:\n\n1. Plug t=0 into the parameterization to get the point (x₀, y₀). Check if y₀ = (5/3)x₀ - 17/3.\n2. The direction vector is given as <a, b>. Check if b/a = 5/3, which would mean the slope is the same as the given line. If a is 0, we need to see if b is non-zero and check the equation differently.\n\nAlright, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nEquation: (x, y) = (4, 1) + t*(-3, -5)\n\nFirst, check the point when t=0: (4, 1). Plug into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x - 17/3\n1 = (5/3)*4 - 17/3\nLet's compute RHS: (5/3)*4 = 20/3; 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 = 1\nSo yes, (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector: (-3, -5). The slope is -5/-3 = 5/3. Which matches the slope of the line. Perfect.\n\nSo Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\nEquation: (x, y) = (17, 5) + t*(6,10)\n\nFirst, check the point when t=0: (17,5). Plug into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3\nCompute RHS: (5/3)*17 -17/3 = (85/3) -17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\nBut y = 5, which is clearly not equal to 68/3. So (17,5) is not on the line.\n\nWait, let's confirm the calculation:\n\n(5/3)*17 = 85/3 ≈ 28.333... Then subtract 17/3: 85/3 -17/3 = 68/3 ≈22.666... Definitely not 5. So point is not on the line. So Option B is invalid.\n\nBut wait, did I compute it right? Maybe I messed up:\n\nWait, the equation is y = (5/3)x -17/3. Plugging x=17:\n\ny = (5/3)(17) -17/3 = (85/3) -17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666. Not 5. So correct, point is off.\n\nSo Option B is out.\n\n**Option C:**\nEquation: (x, y) = (2, -7/3) + t*(3/5, 1)\n\nFirst, check the point: t=0 gives (2, -7/3). Plug into line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3\n\nCompute RHS: (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = -7/3. Which is equal to y= -7/3. So the point is on the line.\n\nGood. Next, check direction vector: (3/5, 1). Compute slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, which is same as the line. Perfect. So the direction is correct.\n\nSo Option C is also valid.\n\n**Option D:**\nEquation: (x, y) = (14/5, -1) + t*(1, 3/5)\n\nCheck the point when t=0: (14/5, -1). Plug into line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3\n\nCompute RHS: (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3. Simplify:\n\n(5/3)*(14/5) = (14)/3. So RHS = 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1.\n\nWhich is equal to y=-1. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector: (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Hmm, but the slope of the line is 5/3. 3/5 is not equal to 5/3. They are reciprocals but not equal. So the direction vector has a different slope.\n\nThus, Option D is invalid because the direction is wrong. So even though the point is on the line, the direction is wrong.\n\n**Option E:**\nEquation: (x, y) = (0, -17/3) + t*(15, -25)\n\nFirst, check the point when t=0: (0, -17/3). Plug into line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nCompute RHS: (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3, which is equal to y. So the point is on the line.\n\nGood. Now, check the direction vector: (15, -25). The slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3. But the line's slope is 5/3. So the direction vector is actually pointing in the opposite direction with slope -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3.\n\nSo, does that matter? Because the direction vector can have any scalar multiple, positive or negative. But in this case, the slope is negative while the line has positive slope.\n\nThus, the direction is incorrect. So even though the point is on the line, the direction is wrong.\n\nTherefore, Option E is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on. The direction vector is (15, -25). So it's equivalent to multiplying by a scalar to see if it's proportional.\n\n15 and -25 can both be divided by 5: 15/5=3, -25/5=-5. So direction vector is 5*(3, -5). So slope is -5/3. Which is different from 5/3.\n\nHence, as before, the direction is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option E is invalid.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nOption A: Valid (point on line and correct slope)\nOption B: Invalid (point not on line)\nOption C: Valid (point on line and correct slope)\nOption D: Invalid (point on line but incorrect slope)\nOption E: Invalid (point on line but incorrect slope)\n\nTherefore, the valid parameterizations are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid, we need to check two things for each option:\n\n1. The point when \\( t = 0 \\) should lie on the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\).\n2. The direction vector should have a slope of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\n**Option A:**\n- Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n- Check: \\( 1 = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} \\) simplifies to \\( 1 = 1 \\), which is true.\n- Direction vector: \\( (-3, -5) \\) has a slope of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n- Valid.\n\n**Option B:**\n- Point: \\( (17, 5) \\)\n- Check: \\( 5 = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} \\) simplifies to \\( 5 \\neq \\frac{68}{3} \\).\n- Invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\n- Point: \\( (2, -\\frac{7}{3}) \\)\n- Check: \\( -\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} \\) simplifies to \\( -\\frac{7}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\), which is true.\n- Direction vector: \\( (\\frac{3}{5}, 1) \\) has a slope of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n- Valid.\n\n**Option D:**\n- Point: \\( (\\frac{14}{5}, -1) \\)\n- Check: \\( -1 = \\frac{5}{3}(\\frac{14}{5}) - \\frac{17}{3} \\) simplifies to \\( -1 = -1 \\), which is true.\n- Direction vector: \\( (1, \\frac{3}{5}) \\) has a slope of \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\), which is not \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n- Invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n- Point: \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\)\n- Check: \\( -\\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} \\), which is true.\n- Direction vector: \\( (15, -25) \\) has a slope of \\( -\\frac{5}{3} \\), which is not \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n- Invalid.\n\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations (A to E) correctly represents the line described by the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The parameterizations are all in vector form, which I think means they show a starting point (a point on the line) and a direction vector (which should be parallel to the line). \n\nFirst, I need to remember that for a parameterization to be correct, two things must be true:\n\n1. The point given in the parameterization must lie on the line. That means when I plug in the x and y values from the vector, it should satisfy the equation of the line.\n\n2. The direction vector must be a direction vector for the line. That is, its components should have the same slope as the line. If I take the direction vector, say (a, b), then the slope should be b/a, which should equal the slope of the line, which is 5/3.\n\nSo, for each option A through E, I'll need to check both conditions.\n\nLet me write down the given line equation again: y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The slope is 5/3. So, the direction vector of any correct parameterization must have a slope of 5/3, meaning that for the direction vector (a, b), b/a should equal 5/3. \n\nAlternatively, since 5/3 is the slope, any direction vector can be a scalar multiple of (3, 5). So, the direction vector in each case should be something like (3k, 5k) where k is a scalar. But looking at the options, each direction vector is different, so I'll check if their ratios match 3 and 5.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nStart point: (4, 1)\n\nDirection vector: (-3, -5)\n\nFirst, check if the direction vector's slope is 5/3.\n\nCompute b/a: (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. So, yes, the slope is correct.\n\nNow, check if the start point lies on the line. Let's plug (4, 1) into y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nCompute (5/3)(4) = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667\n\nSubtract 17/3: 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So, y = 1.\n\nSince the start point (4,1) satisfies the equation, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nStart point: (17, 5)\n\nDirection vector: (6, 10)\n\nFirst, check the slope of the direction vector. 10/6 = 5/3, which is correct.\n\nNow, check if (17,5) lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nCompute (5/3)(17) = 85/3 ≈ 28.3333\n\nSubtract 17/3: 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.6667\n\nBut the y-coordinate is 5, not 68/3, which is approximately 22.6667. So, (17,5) does not satisfy the line equation. Therefore, option B is not valid.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I did that calculation correctly.\n\nWait, if x is 17, plugging into the line equation: y = (5/3)(17) - 17/3\n\nSo, 5/3 * 17 is (5*17)/3 = 85/3\n\nThen, subtracting 17/3: 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3\n\nWhich is equal to 22 and 2/3, which is about 22.6667, which is definitely not 5. So, yes, point (17,5) is not on the line. Therefore, option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nStart point: (2, -7/3)\n\nDirection vector: (3/5, 1)\n\nCheck slope of direction vector: 1 divided by (3/5) is 1*(5/3) = 5/3. So, slope is correct.\n\nCheck if start point lies on the line.\n\nPlug (2, -7/3) into y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nCompute (5/3)(2) = 10/3 ≈ 3.3333\n\nSubtract 17/3: 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3 ≈ -2.3333\n\nWhich is exactly -7/3. So, yes, the point (2, -7/3) lies on the line. Therefore, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nStart point: (14/5, -1)\n\nDirection vector: (1, 3/5)\n\nCheck slope of direction vector: 3/5 divided by 1 is 3/5. Wait, hold on, slope is rise over run, which is 3/5 divided by 1, so 3/5. But the slope of the line is 5/3. So, is 3/5 equal to 5/3? No, they are reciprocals. So, the slope of the direction vector is 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3, the slope of the line.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because if the direction vector's slope is 3/5, then the line would have a slope of 3/5, not 5/3. So, if the line's slope is 5/3, the direction vector must have a slope of 5/3, not 3/5. So, in this case, option D has a direction vector with slope 3/5, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, but just to check, is 3/5 reciprocal to 5/3? Yes, because (3/5)*(5/3)=1. So, yes, they are reciprocals, meaning they are negative reciprocals only if one is negative, but here both are positive. So, no, they are not the same. Therefore, the slope is incorrect. So, option D is invalid.\n\nAlso, for thoroughness, let's check if the start point is on the line.\n\nStart point is (14/5, -1). Plugging into y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nCompute (5/3)*(14/5) = (5 cancels out, so 14/3). Then subtract 17/3: 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So, y = -1.\n\nTherefore, the start point (14/5, -1) does lie on the line. But the direction vector is incorrect since its slope is 3/5 instead of 5/3. Therefore, even though the starting point is correct, the direction vector is wrong, so the parameterization is not correct for the line. So, option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n\nStart point: (0, -17/3)\n\nDirection vector: (15, -25)\n\nFirst, check the slope of the direction vector. So, -25 divided by 15 is -5/3.\n\nSo, the slope is -5/3. But the given line has a slope of 5/3, so the direction vector is going in the opposite direction. So, is that still acceptable? Well, the direction vector can point in either direction; it just needs to have a direction consistent with the line. Since lines extend infinitely in both directions, both (15, -25) and (-15,25) would be valid direction vectors because they're scalar multiples (by -1) of each other.\n\nBut let's check if the slope of the line is 5/3 or if the direction vector slope should be 5/3 or -5/3?\n\nWait, in the problem, the line is given as y = (5/3)x -17/3. So, it's a straight line with positive slope 5/3, so direction vectors should have a positive slope. However, if someone uses a direction vector with a negative slope, that is, moving in the opposite direction, but as long as it's consistent with the direction of the line, it's still acceptable because parameterization can move in either direction.\n\nBut in this case, the direction vector (15, -25) is not in the same direction as the line. The slope is negative. So, to move along the line, you would need to have a direction vector with a positive slope. But regardless, as long as the vector lies on the line, it can be in any direction.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I need to clarify. The direction vector's slope should match the slope of the line, which is 5/3. So, if a direction vector has a slope of 5/3, then it is parallel to the line; if it has a slope of -5/3, it's not parallel because the direction is opposite but magnitude is different.\n\nWait, wait, actually, direction vector slope is the same as the slope of the line, so if direction vector is (15, -25), slope is -25/15 = -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3. Therefore, even though it's a scalar multiple, since it's in the opposite direction, but the slope is different. Therefore, it's not a valid direction vector for the line, because it's not in the same direction as the line's slope.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. The direction vector can be any non-zero scalar multiple as long as its slope is the same as the line. So, if the slope is correct, it's okay.\n\nWait, let's check again. The slope of the direction vector (15, -25) is -25/15 = -5/3, which is different from the line's slope of 5/3. Therefore, direction vector is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, even though the starting point is on the line (we can check that too), because the direction vector has the wrong slope, the parameterization is not correct.\n\nCheck starting point: (0, -17/3)\n\nPlug into y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\n(5/3)(0) = 0, 0 -17/3 = -17/3. So, y = -17/3. Correct. So, starting point is on the line, but direction vector has slope -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\nOption A: Correct\n\nOption B: Incorrect (start point not on the line)\n\nOption C: Correct\n\nOption D: Incorrect (direction vector slope is 3/5 instead of 5/3)\n\nOption E: Incorrect (direction vector slope is -5/3 instead of 5/3)\n\nTherefore, only options A and C are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, before finalizing, let me double-check option C.\n\nOption C: Start point (2, -7/3)\n\nCompute y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nAt x=2: y = (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = -7/3. So, yes, the point is on the line.\n\nDirection vector (3/5, 1). So, slope is 1 divided by (3/5) which is 5/3, which matches the line's slope. Therefore, yes, correct.\n\nOption A: start point (4,1)\n\nCheck y = (5/3)(4) -17/3 = 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 =1. So, y=1, which matches.\n\nDirection vector (-3, -5). Slope is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. So, correct.\n\nHence, A and C are correct.\n\nI think that's thorough. So, the valid options are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C, so the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n\nBut wait, the user said to put the final answer within \\boxed{}, and since multiple letters are required, separated by commas.\n\nWait, the problem is, in the initial prompt, the user wrote \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nBut in the instruction, they asked to write the final answer within \\boxed{}, so perhaps I need to put all correct options inside \\boxed{A,C} or something like that. But usually, in these multiple-choice, single-select contexts, they specify, but here it's multiple.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem says: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nSo, the final answer is to be \"A, C\". So, in a box.\n\nBut in the previous example, the user's answer was within \\boxed{} with multiple letters.\n\nI think I should do the same.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is to put both A and C in a single box, separated by commas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the user wrote:\n\n\"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nSo, the instructions said to put the final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nSo, if I have multiple answers, perhaps all in one box, as \\boxed{A, C}.\n\nBut looking at the previous examples, sometimes it's written as a list inside the box.\n\nAlternatively, if the system allows, \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}, but I think, in this context, as the original answer, the user presented a single box with the letters separated by commas.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is \\boxed{A, C}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A, C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two conditions for each parameterization: \n1.

                "full_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations is valid for the line described by the equation \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\). The options are labeled (A) through (E), and I need to figure out which ones correctly represent this line.\n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form looks like this: \n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a specific point on the line (the initial point), and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector of the line.\n\nTo check if each option is a valid parameterization, I should verify two things for each one:\n1. Does the initial point \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) lie on the given line?\n2. Is the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) a direction vector for the line? In other words, is \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the line?\n\nLet me recall that for a line in slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\), the direction vector can be written as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ m \\end{pmatrix} \\). So in this case, since the slope \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\), any direction vector that's a multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) would be valid because the direction vector components correspond to the run and rise.\n\nAlternatively, the direction vector could be scaled up or down, but the components should maintain the same ratio as the slope. So, if the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), then \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{5}{3} \\). So, cross-multiplying, \\( 3b = 5a \\). I can use this to check each parameterization.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if the initial point (4,1) is on the line.\n\nPlug \\( x = 4 \\) into the line equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1\n\\]\nSo, yes, (4,1) is on the line. That's good.\n\nNow, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's see if it's a multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Well, if we multiply the direction vector by -1, we get \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is the standard direction vector. So, direction vector is valid.\n\nThus, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCheck if (17,5) is on the line.\n\nPlug \\( x = 17 \\) into the line equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.666...\n\\]\nBut the y-coordinate in the initial point is 5, which is nowhere near \\( \\frac{68}{3} \\). So, the initial point is not on the line. Therefore, option (B) is invalid.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check the initial point (2, -7/3).\n\nPlug \\( x = 2 \\) into the line equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\nPerfect, that's the given y-coordinate, so the initial point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's see if it's a multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nLet me see: if I multiply the direction vector by 5/3, I get:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\times 5/3 \\\\ 1 \\times 5/3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 5/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nHmm, that's not the same as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Maybe I should check if the components are in the same ratio.\n\nSo, for direction vector components \\( a = 3/5 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\), the slope is \\( b/a = 1 / (3/5) = 5/3 \\), which is the same as the slope of the line. Therefore, the direction vector is a valid one since it gives the correct slope.\n\nAlternatively, since when multiplied by a scalar, the direction vector should match the slope. Indeed, direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) satisfies \\( y = (5/3)x \\), so in parametric terms, the direction vector should maintain this slope.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if the initial point (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nPlug \\( x = 14/5 \\) into the line equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3} \\times \\frac{14}{5} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{3}{3} = -1\n\\]\nPerfect, the y-coordinate matches. So, initial point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope here is \\( 3/5 / 1 = 3/5 \\), but the slope of our line is 5/3, not 3/5. So, that's different. Wait, but direction vectors can have direction either way. Wait, but the slope from the direction vector is different.\n\nWait, actually, in parametric equations, the direction vector's slope is calculated as \\( dy/dx \\), so for direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), the slope would be \\( (3/5)/1 = 3/5 \\). But our line has a slope of 5/3. So, 3/5 is not equal to 5/3, so the direction vector is not in the same direction as the line.\n\nWait, but perhaps is it a scalar multiple? Let me see. Is \\( 3/5 \\) equal to \\( 5/3 \\)? No, unless you flip it and multiply by -1, which would get -3/5 and -5/3. Wait, no, actually, to check if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.\n\nLet me check if \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) for some scalar k.\n\nSo, \\( 1 = 3k \\) and \\( 3/5 = 5k \\). Solving for k from the first equation: \\( k = 1/3 \\). Then, check the second equation: \\( 3/5 = 5*(1/3) = 5/3 \\). Is 3/5 equal to 5/3? No, because 3/5 is 0.6 and 5/3 is approximately 1.666. So, no, they are not scalar multiples. Therefore, the direction vector is not in the correct direction.\n\nWait a second, but actually, the direction vector for the line \\( y = (5/3)x - 17/3 \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is valid because if you go 3 in x, 5 in y, that's the slope 5/3. So, in option (D), the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which, when multiplied by 5, becomes \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is the opposite direction but still a valid direction vector because it can go both ways.\n\nWait, is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)?\n\nLet me check: does there exist a scalar k such that:\n1 = 3k\n3/5 = 5k\n\nFrom the first equation, k = 1/3. Plugging into the second equation: 5*(1/3) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666, but the second component is 3/5 = 0.6. These are not equal, so k is not consistent. Hence, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), so it is not a valid direction vector for the given line.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is invalid because the direction vector doesn't lie along the line.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think. The direction vector is a vector that the line is pointing in, so technically, it can be any vector that is a scalar multiple, including negatives, but only along that line. So, for direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), is that pointing in the same direction as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)?\n\nWait, if I multiply \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) by 5, I get \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is a different vector, but it's in the opposite direction of the original direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). But since the direction vector can be in either direction along the line, technically, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is still a valid direction vector because it just points in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, but is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\) a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)? Let's check if there exists a scalar k where \\( 5 = 3k \\) and \\( 3 = 5k \\).\n\nFrom the first equation: k = 5/3. Then from the second equation: 3 = 5*(5/3) = 25/3 ≈ 8.333, which is not equal to 3. So, no, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Therefore, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), so the direction vector isn't valid.\n\nHence, option (D) is invalid.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. On one hand, if the direction vector is reversed, it's still pointing along the same line, just the opposite direction. So, perhaps direction vectors are considered valid regardless of direction.\n\nWait, actually, in mathematics, a direction vector is any vector whose direction is along the line, regardless of the sign. So, if the line's slope is 5/3, then any vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) such that \\( b/a = 5/3 \\) is a direction vector. So, if I have \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) where \\( b = (5/3)a \\), then it's a direction vector.\n\nSo, for \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), is \\( (3/5)/1 = 3/5 \\), which is not equal to 5/3. Therefore, it's not a valid direction vector. Therefore, even if the vector points in the opposite direction, as long as it doesn't have the correct slope, it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is invalid.\n\nWait, but hold on, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) has slope 3/5, which is the reciprocal of the line's slope. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in parametric terms, when you reverse the direction, you would have to have a negative of the slope.\n\nWait, is that related? Maybe.\n\nBut, I think regardless, for the direction vector to correctly represent the direction of the line, it should have the same slope.\n\nSo, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) has slope 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3, which is the slope of the line. So, therefore, the direction vector is not correct.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is invalid.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have a vector that's scaled down, but in the opposite direction, you can still reach the same line by adjusting the parameter t.\n\nWait, perhaps. Wait, no, if the direction vector has the wrong slope, even if you scale t, the line traced by the parameterization would still have that slope, right?\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose I have a parameterization with direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then, as t varies, you move in the direction of that vector, but if that vector has a different slope than the line, then the parameterized line wouldn't lie on the original line.\n\nSo, in option (D), even though (14/5, -1) is on the line, the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) defines a different line with slope 3/5, which is different from the original line's slope. Therefore, the entire parameterization doesn't lie on the given line.\n\nWait, but if you plug in t=0, you get the point (14/5, -1). As t increases, you move in the direction of (1, 3/5). So, each point on the parameterization would be:\n\nx(t) = 14/5 + t*(1) = 14/5 + t\n\ny(t) = -1 + t*(3/5) = -1 + (3/5)t\n\nBut does this lie on the original line? Let's test t=0: it's (14/5, -1), which is on the original line.\n\nt=1: (14/5 +1, -1 + 3/5) = (19/5, -2/5)\n\nCheck if (19/5, -2/5) is on the original line:\n\ny = (5/3)(19/5) -17/3 = (19/3) -17/3 = (2/3) ≈ 0.666. But in the parameterization, y= -2/5 = -0.4, which is different. So, not on the line.\n\nTherefore, even though the initial point is on the line, the direction vector leads to points not on the line, so the entire parameterization doesn't lie on the original line.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is invalid.\n\nOkay, so now moving on.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check the initial point (0, -17/3). Plug x=0 into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(0) -17/3 = -17/3, which matches. So, initial point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nCompute the slope: \\( \\",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations is valid for the line described by the equation \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\). The parameterizations are labeled (A) through (E), and I need to figure out which ones correctly represent this line.\n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally given by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So each option provides a point and a direction vector. My job is to check if each option's point lies on the given line and if their direction vectors are parallel to the line.\n\nLet me write down the given line equation again: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\). The slope of this line is \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\), so the direction vector should have a slope of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). This means that if the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), then \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{5}{3} \\). So I can check each option's direction vector to see if it simplifies to that ratio.\n\nAdditionally, I need to verify if the given points in each parameterization satisfy the equation of the line. So for each parameter (A) through (E), I will check both the direction vector and the point.\n\nLet's start with option (A):\n\n(A) \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check the point (4,1). Plug x = 4 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\).\n\nSo the point (4,1) is on the line. Good.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. It is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's compute the slope: \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which matches the slope of the line. So the direction is correct. Therefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\n(B) \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check the point (17,5). Plug x =17 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.6667 \\).\n\nBut in the parameterization, y =5 when x=17. So 5 is not equal to \\( \\frac{68}{3} \\). Therefore, the point (17,5) is not on the line. So even before checking the direction vector, this option is invalid.\n\nJust to be thorough, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope is \\( \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which is correct. But since the point doesn't lie on the line, the parameterization is invalid. So option (B) is out.\n\nOption (C):\n\n(C) \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check the point (2, -7/3). Plug x=2 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\).\n\nSo y = -7/3, which matches. Good.\n\nNow, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let me check its slope: \\( \\frac{1}{3/5} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which is correct. Therefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption (D):\n\n(D) \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check the point (14/5, -1). Plug x=14/5 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(14/5) - \\frac{17}{3} \\).\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{3} \\times \\frac{14}{5} = \\frac{14}{3} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( y = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{3}{3} = -1 \\).\n\nSo the point (14/5, -1) is on the line. Good.\n\nNext, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope is \\( \\frac{3/5}{1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\). Hmm, that's not equal to the slope of the line which is \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, the slope is \\( \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{3/5}{1} = 3/5 \\). But the line has a slope of 5/3, which is different. So the direction vector's slope is 3/5, which is the reciprocal of 5/3. Hmm, is that acceptable? Well, actually, direction vectors can have different slopes as long as they're scalar multiples, but actually, in this case, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the slope of the line.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, if the direction vector's slope is different from the line's slope, then it's a different direction. So actually, this direction vector is not parallel to the line. Therefore, the parameterization is not correct.\n\nWait, hold on. The slope of the direction vector is 3/5, but the slope of the line is 5/3. These are negative reciprocals if one is negative, but both are positive here. Wait, actually, reciprocal but not negative reciprocal. So, actually, they are not parallel because the direction vector's slope is the inverse of the line's slope. That would mean that if you multiply the direction vector by its reciprocal, you don't get the slope of the line.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. For direction vectors, the slope should be equal to the slope of the line. So the direction vector's slope should be 5/3, not 3/5.\n\nSo in this case, the direction vector is giving a slope of 3/5, which is not the same as the line's slope of 5/3. Therefore, even though it's a scalar multiple in some sense, the direction is not correct. Wait, actually, maybe it is, because if you have a direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), it can have a slope \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\). So as long as \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), it's fine. But in this case, it's \\( \\frac{3/5}{1} = 3/5 \\), which is not 5/3. Therefore, option (D) has the wrong direction vector. Therefore, it is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm confused. Let me verify.\n\nIf a line has a slope of 5/3, then any direction vector for the line should satisfy \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{5}{3} \\). So in option (D), \\( \\frac{3/5}{1} = 3/5 \\), which is not equal to 5/3. Therefore, it's not a valid direction vector. So the parameterization is incorrect, even though the point lies on the line.\n\nThus, option (D) is invalid.\n\nMoving on to option (E):\n\n(E) \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check the point (0, -17/3). Plug x=0 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3} \\), which matches. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's compute its slope: \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\). Hmm, that's negative. The line has a slope of 5/3, so this direction vector is pointing downward, whereas the line slopes upward. Therefore, is this a problem?\n\nWait, direction vectors can point in any direction, as long as they have the same slope as the line, regardless of direction. But in terms of the slope, is -5/3 equivalent to 5/3?\n\nNo, they are negatives. However, the slope of the direction vector is the rate of change of y with respect to x. The line has a positive slope, so moving in the direction of the vector should either both increase x and y or both decrease. However, direction vectors can have negative components, but when considering the slope, the direction vector's slope needs to match the line's slope.\n\nWait, actually, the slope of the direction vector is -5/3, but the line's slope is 5/3. So, the direction vector is giving a slope of -5/3, which is the negative of the line's slope. Therefore, this would be equivalent to a direction vector going in the opposite direction on the line. But in parametrization, t can be any real number, positive or negative, so it should still cover the entire line. Wait, so does a negative direction vector cause any issues?\n\nHmm, let's think. If I have a direction vector with slope -5/3, it's not the same as 5/3, so the line traced by the parameterization would be different, right? Because with a direction vector of slope -5/3, the line would have a negative slope, which contradicts our original line's positive slope of 5/3.\n\nWait, but is that the case? No, actually, wait: a direction vector is just a vector that points in the direction of the line. So, as long as the direction vector's slope matches the line's slope, it's fine. But in this case, the direction vector has slope -5/3, which is not 5/3. So the direction is different. So even though the point is on the line, the direction vector's slope is not matching, so the parametrization is not correct.\n\nWait, but is that necessarily true? Let me clarify.\n\nThe direction vector should be such that it's parallel to the line, meaning the direction vector's slope should equal the slope of the line. In this case, slope of the line is 5/3, slope of the direction vector is -5/3. These are negative reciprocals if multiplied together, but not equal. So yes, the direction is different, so it's not a valid parameterization.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is invalid because the direction vector's slope is -5/3 instead of 5/3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, if the direction vector is scaled by a negative factor, it would still represent the same line, just in the opposite direction. So even though the slope is negative, the parametrization would still cover the same line because t can be positive or negative. Hmm, this might be a case of confusion.\n\nLet me think more carefully. If the direction vector has a slope that is the negative reciprocal, then it's perpendicular. But in this case, if the direction vector has the same slope as the line, but negative, then it's just pointing in the opposite direction.\n\nBut in parametrization, direction vector can point either way as t varies over all real numbers. So the parametrization will still lie on the line, even if the direction vector points in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, that's correct. The parameter t can take any real value, so if you have a direction vector that's opposite in direction, as long as the point is correct, it still covers the line.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the slope is different. If the direction vector has a different slope, then it's not the same line. Because the slope is a characteristic of the line, so if the direction vector has a different slope, it's a different line.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my previous thought.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nTwo lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples. They are the same line if they have the same direction vector and a common point.\n\nIn this case, the parametrization is about the same line as given by the equation, so the direction vector's slope must match exactly.\n\nIn option (E), the direction vector has slope -5/3, whereas the original line has slope 5/3. Since -5/3 ≠ 5/3, even though they are negatives, it's a different line. So even though it's a scalar multiple in terms of direction (if you reverse the vector), it's not the same slope. Thus, it's a different line, so it's invalid as a parameterization.\n\nWait, but direction vector being a scalar multiple is about scaling, not the sign. So scalar multiples include both positive and negative scalars. But direction vectors can point in either direction, so if you have a direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), then \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -a \\\\ -b \\end{pmatrix} \\) is just the same line but traced in the opposite direction. So in that sense, it's still valid.\n\nBut in this case, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's compute if it's a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the original line. The original slope is 5/3, so the direction vector for the original line could be \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), since \\( 5/3 \\) is the slope.\n\nBut this direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So if I check if \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) for some scalar k, then:\n\n15 = 3k => k = 5\n\n-25 = 5k => k = -5\n\nWhich is a contradiction, so this direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the line. Therefore, it does not represent the same line.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is invalid because the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the given line's direction vector.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n(A): Point correct, direction vector correct slope: valid.\n\n(B): Point incorrect: invalid.\n\n(C): Point correct, direction vector correct slope: valid.\n\n(D): Point correct, but direction vector incorrect slope: invalid.\n\n(E): Point correct, but direction vector incorrect slope: invalid.\n\nTherefore, the valid options are (A) and (C).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct options are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line described by the equation \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check if each given parameterization's point lies on the line and if their direction vectors have the correct slope.\n\n1. **Option (A)**:\n   - Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n     - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

Hmm, parameterization means expressing the line in terms of a vector equation using a point and a direction vector. \n\nI remember that the general form is r = r₀ + t*v, where r₀ is a point on the line and v is the direction vector. So, each option gives me a point and a direction vector. My goal is to check for each option whether the given point lies on the line and whether the direction vector is parallel to the line.\n\nLet me start by checking each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (A): The parameterization is (x, y) = (4, 1) + t*(-3, -5). First, I need to see if the point (4, 1) is on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Plugging x=4 into the equation: y = (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So, yes, (4,1) is on the line. Now, check the direction vector (-3, -5). The slope of this vector is rise over run, which is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. The slope of the given line is also 5/3. So, the direction vector is correct because it has the same slope as the line. Therefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option (B): (x, y) = (17, 5) + t*(6, 10). Let's check if (17, 5) lies on the line. Plugging x=17 into y = (5/3)x -17/3: y = (85/3) -17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666, but the y-coordinate given is 5. So, 5 is not equal to 68/3. Therefore, this point is not on the line. Since a parameterization must pass through at least one point on the line, option (B) is invalid.\n\nNext is option (C): (x, y) = (2, -7/3) + t*(3/5, 1). Let's check if (2, -7/3) is on the line. Plugging x=2 into y = (5/3)x -17/3: y = (10/3) -17/3 = (-7)/3, which is exactly the y-coordinate given. Good. Now, the direction vector is (3/5, 1). The slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, same as the line. So, this direction vector is correct. Therefore, option (C) is valid.\n\nOption (D): (x, y) = (14/5, -1) + t*(1, 3/5). First, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line. x=14/5, so y should be (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3. Simplifying: (14/3) -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. Perfect, the point lies on the line. Now, check the direction vector (1, 3/5). The slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, but the slope of the line is 5/3, which is not the same as 3/5. That means the direction vector is not parallel to the line. Hence, this parameterization is not valid because the line would have a different slope. So, option (D) is invalid.\n\nFinally, option (E): (x, y) = (0, -17/3) + t*(15, -25). Let's check if (0, -17/3) is on the line. For x=0, y should be (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3, which matches the point given. Good. Now, the direction vector is (15, -25). The slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3. Hmm, the slope of the given line is 5/3, so this is the negative reciprocal. That means this direction vector is perpendicular to the line, not parallel. So, the line would have the slope -5/3 instead of 5/3. Therefore, option (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I should double-check the slope. Let me compute slope from the direction vector. For (15, -25), the rise is -25 and run is 15, so slope is -25/15 = -5/3. But the line's slope is 5/3, which is positive, while -5/3 is negative. Therefore, since the direction vector has a different sign, it's not a scalar multiple of the original direction vector which should have slope 5/3. So, yeah, it's incorrect. So option (E) is out.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\n(A) passes through a point on the line and has correct direction. Valid.\n\n(B) Point not on the line. Invalid.\n\n(C) Point on line and correct direction. Valid.\n\n(D) Point on line, but direction vector slope incorrect. Invalid.\n\n(E) Point on line, but direction vector slope is incorrect. Invalid.\n\nSo, the valid ones are (A) and (C).\n\nI think that's it. Did I make any mistakes? Let's just verify.\n\nFor (A): Check direction vector: ( -3, -5). Slope is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which is same as the line.\n\nFor (C): Direction vector (3/5, 1). Slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, same as line.\n\nAnd both initial points satisfy the line equation. So yes, (A) and (C) are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line defined by the equation \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check if the given point lies on the line and if the direction vector is parallel to the line.\n\n1. **Option (A)**:\n   - Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check if it lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations of a line are valid. The line in question has the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. I have five options labeled (A) through (E), each presenting a different parameterization. My task is to figure out which of these parameterizations correctly represents the given line.\n\nFirst off, I should recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally given as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line (position vector), and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector of the line. So, for each option, I need to check two things:\n1. Does the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) correspond to the slope of the line?\n2. Does the point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) lie on the given line?\n\nLet me write down the given line equation again: y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The slope (m) of this line is 5/3. The direction vector's slope should match this. So, for each parameterization, the slope of the direction vector should be 5/3 when simplified.\n\nSimplifying the direction vector: if the direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} b_x \\\\ b_y \\end{pmatrix}\\), then the slope is b_y / b_x. This should be equal to 5/3. Let me compute this ratio for each parameterization.\n\nMoving on, for each option, I'll do two checks:\n\n1. **Check the Direction Vector's Slope:**\n   Calculate b_y / b_x for each option's direction vector. It should be equal to 5/3.\n\n2. **Check if the Point Lies on the Line:**\n   Substitute the coordinates of the point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) into the line equation to see if they satisfy y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied for a parameterization, then it's a valid parameterization of the given line.\n\nAlright, let's tackle each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n1. **Direction Vector Slope:**\n   Direction vector is (-3, -5). So, slope = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Good, that matches the line's slope.\n   \n2. **Point on Line:**\n   The point is (4, 1). Let's plug into the line equation:\n   y = (5/3)x - 17/3\n   1 = (5/3)(4) - 17/3\n   Calculate (5/3)*4: 20/3 ≈ 6.666...\n   Then, 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. Perfect, y=1. So this point is on the line.\n\n**Conclusion for (A):** Valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n1. **Direction Vector Slope:**\n   Direction vector is (6, 10). Slope = 10/6 = 5/3. Perfect, slope matches.\n\n2. **Point on Line:**\n   Point is (17,5). Plug into the line equation:\n   y = (5/3)(17) - 17/3\n   Compute (5/3)*17: 85/3 ≈ 28.333...\n   Subtract 17/3: 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\n   But y is given as 5. Clearly, 5 ≈ 22.666... is not true. So this point is not on the line.\n\n**Conclusion for (B):** Invalid parameterization.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n1. **Direction Vector Slope:**\n   Direction vector is (3/5, 1). Slope = 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. Correct slope.\n\n2. **Point on Line:**\n   Point is (2, -7/3). Plugging into the line equation:\n   y = (5/3)(2) - 17/3\n   Calculate (5/3)*2 = 10/3\n   10/3 - 17/3 = -7/3. Perfect, y = -7/3. So the point lies on the line.\n\n**Conclusion for (C):** Valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n1. **Direction Vector Slope:**\n   Direction vector is (1, 3/5). Slope = (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Hmm, 3/5 is not equal to 5/3. That’s a problem because the slope of the given line is 5/3, but this direction vector has a slope of 3/5, which is the negative reciprocal of 5/3. So that doesn't match. Therefore, this is a problem.\n\n   Wait, hold on, is 3/5 the reciprocal of 5/3? Let me think. The reciprocal of 5/3 is 3/5, but reciprocal with a negative sign would be -3/5, so actually, 3/5 is not the reciprocal, it's just another fraction. However, in terms of slopes, if two lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. Here, 5/3 * 3/5 = 1, not -1. So they aren't negative reciprocals, which would be required for perpendicularity, but we don't want that. Since 5/3 * 3/5 = 1, meaning they are multiplicative inverses, but neither is negative. So the direction vector here has a different slope, 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3. So that already disqualifies it. Therefore, the direction is not correct, so option (D) is invalid.\n\n   Wait, just to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\n   Direction vector (1, 3/5) is slope 3/5, which is approximately 0.6. Our line has a slope of 5/3, which is approximately 1.666..., which is steeper. So, clearly, different slopes, so direction vector is wrong. Hence, no.\n\n**Conclusion for (D):** Invalid parameterization.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n1. **Direction Vector Slope:**\n   Direction vector is (15, -25). So, slope = (-25)/15 = -5/3. Hmm, -5/3 is not 5/3. Hmm, so the slope is negative here, whereas our line is positive slope. Therefore, this is a problem. It's not matching.\n\n   Wait, but maybe they are scalar multiples with negative sign. Let me check if direction vector can be scaled to get 5/3.\n\n   The direction vector here is (15, -25). If I factor out 5, it becomes 5*(3, -5). Then the slope would be (-5)/3, which is -5/3. So, if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3, -5), its slope is -5/3, not 5/3. So, no, this is incorrect. Therefore, the slope is negative, so this direction is different. So it's invalid.\n\n2. However, even if slope was correct, let's check the point.\n\n3. **Point on Line:**\n   Point is (0, -17/3). Plugging into the line equation:\n   y = (5/3)x - 17/3\n   When x = 0: y = -17/3. Perfect, that's the point (0, -17/3). So, the point lies on the line, which is good. But the slope is not correct.\n\nTherefore, Option (E): direction vector has wrong slope.\n\nSo, conclusion is invalid parameterization.\n\nBut, hold on, I think I made a mistake in assuming direction vector can't be scaled to give the correct slope. However, in parametric equations, even if direction vector has negative slope, perhaps scaled with a negative parameter?\n\nWait, no. Because if the direction vector is scaled with t being any real number, positive or negative. So, if you have a direction vector with negative slope, it's still a valid direction vector for the line, but only when allowing t to take positive and negative values. However, the slope of the line is still determined by the direction vector.\n\nWait, no. Actually, direction vectors can be any vector parallel to the line, regardless of direction. So, a direction vector of (15, -25) is directionally opposite to (3, -5), but it's still along the same line, just in the opposite direction. So, if t can be any real number, negative or positive, it's still acceptable because t can take negative values. So actually, maybe even with a direction vector of negative slope, it's still correct because t can be any real number.\n\nBut hold on, the line given is y = (5/3)x - 17/3, which has a positive slope. So, even though direction vector (15, -25) has a negative slope, the parametric line would be the same line because direction vector is a scalar multiple of any other direction vector. Wait, direction vector just defines the direction, but parametric equations can have direction vectors in either direction as t varies over all real numbers.\n\nBut in this case, since the direction vector is (15, -25), which is a vector going to the right and down, while the line y = (5/3)x -17/3 goes to the right and up, since the slope is positive.\n\nWait, hang on. The direction vector for a line with positive slope should be such that as t increases, x and y both increase. So, direction vector (15, -25) is going to have x increasing while y decreases, which would be opposite to the direction of the line. But, if t can go both positive and negative, then starting from (0, -17/3), if t is positive, x increases and y decreases, which is opposite to the line, and if t is negative, x decreases and y increases, which would also be opposite to the line.\n\nWait, actually, the line has slope 5/3, so if you have a direction vector, it's (3,5) or any scalar multiple, but direction vector (15, -25) would take you from (0, -17/3) to (15, -17/3 -25) = (15, -42/3 -75/3) = (15, -117/3), which is further away, but only in the direction of increasing x and decreasing y. So, actually, it's not going along the line, which requires increasing both x and y when moving in the positive t direction.\n\nWait, but hold on, (15, -25) is not a direction vector of the given line. Wait, direction vector of the given line is any scalar multiple of (3,5), right? Because slope is 5/3, so (3,5) is the direction vector. So, to see if (15, -25) is a scalar multiple of (3,5). Let me see.\n\nIf I factor out 5 from (15, -25): 5*(3, -5). So, (3, -5) is the direction vector. So, it's (3,5) flipped in y-component, so it's pointing in a different direction, not along the line with positive slope. Thus, it would not lie on the given line.\n\nWait, but to be precise, actually, in parametric equations, direction vector (a, b) defines the direction of the line. If the direction vector is pointing in a different direction than the slope, then the line may not be consistent.\n\nWait, but actually, direction vectors are just directions, regardless of where they start. So, even if direction vector is opposite, since t can be positive or negative, it can still cover the entire line. However, in this case, the line has a positive slope, so moving in one direction (with positive t) would go up and to the right, and moving in the negative direction (with negative t) would go down and to the left. So, direction vector (15, -25) would point down and to the right. So, in the parametric equation, it's moving in the opposite direction, but t can be positive or negative, so you can still reach every point on the line.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, the point (0, -17/3) is on the line, which is the y-intercept. So, starting at (0, -17/3), moving with direction vector (15, -25) in either direction would trace the entire line, but traversed in opposite directions.\n\nBut in the parameterization, the direction vector is (15, -25), so as t increases, you go in one direction, and as t decreases, you go in the opposite direction. So, as such, it should still correctly represent the line, but just traversed in the opposite direction.\n\nBut let me see, the direction vector has slope -5/3, whereas the line has slope 5/3. So, they are not the same. So, is that a problem? Because, technically, a parameterization with direction vector that's a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector should still represent the same line, regardless of direction, because parameter t can be negative.\n\nWait, suppose the direction vector is (3, 5). Then, for t positive, you go in one direction, and for t negative, you go in the opposite direction. Similarly, if direction vector is (15, -25), which is a scalar multiple (5*(3, -5)), so it's a direction vector that's scaling with a negative y-component.\n\nSo, can both directions cover the entire line? Yes, because for t positive, it's going in one direction, and for t negative, it's going in the opposite. So, parameterization is still correct, because t can take any real value, so direction vector's sign can be adjusted by t's sign.\n\nWait, but I think the critical factor is whether the direction vector is parallel to the line. So, the direction vector (15, -25) is parallel to (3, -5), which is the opposite direction of (3,5). But (3,-5) is parallel to the line? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me recast.\n\nThe slope of the line is 5/3, so a direction vector should have slope 5/3. A direction vector (3,5) has slope 5/3. Direction vector (15,25) also has slope 5/3 (25/15 = 5/3). But direction vector (15, -25) has slope -25/15 = -5/3, which is the negative reciprocal, meaning it's perpendicular to the direction vector (3,5), or in other words, it's pointing in the direction opposite to the line.\n\nBut wait, in 2D, if two vectors have the same magnitude in slope, they are either parallel or not. Wait, maybe I confused something. The direction vector (15, -25) is a scalar multiple of (3, -5). So, whether this is parallel or not? If it's a scalar multiple, then yes, they are parallel, but if scaled by a negative scalar, it's in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, in terms of direction, yes, (15, -25) is parallel but in the opposite direction, but since parameter t can be both positive and negative, the entire line is covered regardless.\n\nBut hold on, wait. The direction vector should lie along the line, but in this case, the direction vector (15, -25) is pointing in the opposite direction relative to the line's slope. But is it still acceptable?\n\nWait, in parametric equations, the direction vector is just any vector parallel to the line, regardless of direction, because with t ranging over all real numbers, you can go in either direction.\n\nSo, direction vector (15, -25) is parallel to (3, -5), which is not the direction of the line, which is (3,5). Wait, hold on, that's different.\n\nWait, the direction vector of the line is (3,5). Direction vector (15,25) is parallel. Direction vector (3, -5) is in the opposite direction to the line, but not necessarily parallel.\n\nWait, wait, in the given line, y = (5/3)x -17/3. So, if I have a direction vector (3,5), that would be consistent with slope 5/3. Direction vector (3, -5) would have slope -5/3, which is different. Therefore, direction vector (15, -25) is (5*(3, -5)), which is not parallel to the given line's direction vector. Thus, the direction is not correct.\n\nHence, even though (15, -25) is a scalar multiple of (3, -5), which is a different direction, so it",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line defined by the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The parameterizations are options A through E, each giving a point and a direction vector. I need to figure out which ones lie on the line and if their direction vectors are consistent with the line's slope.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form is given by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, for each option, I should check two things: whether the given point lies on the line, and whether the direction vector has the correct slope.\n\nStarting with option A:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet me check if (4,1) is on the line y = (5/3)x -17/3. Substituting x=4 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(4) -17/3 = 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 = 1. Perfect, so (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is (-3, -5). The slope of the line is 5/3, so the direction vector should have a slope of -5/-3 = 5/3, which is the same as the line's slope. Therefore, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option B:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if (17,5) is on the line. Plugging x=17 into y = (5/3)(17) -17/3. Let's calculate:\n\n(5/3)(17) = 85/3. Subtracting 17/3 gives 68/3 ≈ 22.666..., but y=5 which is much smaller. So, 5 ≈ 22.666 is not correct. Thus, (17,5) is not on the line. So, option B is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I did the math wrong. Let me check again:\n(5/3)*17 = (5*17)/3 = 85/3 ≈ 28.333. Then subtract 17/3: 85/3 -17/3 = 68/3 ≈22.666. So, y=5 is nowhere near 22.666. Therefore, option B is not on the line. So, option B is invalid.\n\nOption C:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line. Plugging x=2 into the equation: y=(5/3)(2) -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = -7/3. Perfect, so it is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector. The direction vector is (3/5, 1). The slope here would be 1/(3/5) = 5/3, which is the same as the line's slope. Therefore, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption D:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCheck if (14/5, -1) is on the line. x =14/5, so y should be (5/3)(14/5) -17/3.\n\nSimplify (5/3)(14/5): the 5's cancel, giving 14/3. Then subtract 17/3: 14/3 -17/3 = -3/3 = -1. So y = -1, which matches. Therefore, the point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. Direction vector is (1, 3/5). The slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, the line's slope is 5/3, so 3/5 is the reciprocal. Hmm, is that a problem? Wait, no. Actually, the slope of the line is 5/3, so the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 or any scalar multiple, but the given direction vector has slope 3/5. So, is 3/5 the same as 5/3? No, they are reciprocals. Therefore, that's not the same slope. So, is the direction vector correct?\n\nWait, no, actually, the direction vector's slope is 3/5. But the line's slope is 5/3. So, the direction vector is not correctly aligned. Hmm, does that mean it's invalid? Because the direction vector needs to have a slope of 5/3, but here it's 3/5. So, that's a different direction, which would mean the parameterization is not on the line.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the direction vector is okay because it's just a different direction but still valid? Wait, no, because if the direction vector is wrong, then the line parameterization will be going in the wrong direction. So, for example, if you have a direction vector with slope 3/5, you can't reach points on the original line unless it's the same slope or a scalar multiple.\n\nWait, actually, if you have direction vectors that are scalar multiples, then they represent the same line. But if the direction vector isn't a scalar multiple, then they're different lines. So, since the slope is different, the direction is different. So, this would mean that it's a different line.\n\nTherefore, even though the starting point is on the given line, the direction vector is wrong. Therefore, the parameterization represents a different line, not the given line. Therefore, option D is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculation of the direction vector's slope. The direction vector is (1, 3/5), so rise over run is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, which is different from 5/3, which is the line's slope. So, yes, that's correct. So, option D is invalid.\n\nOption E:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if the point (0, -17/3) is on the line. Plugging x=0 into the equation: y=(5/3)(0) -17/3 = -17/3. Perfect, so (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is (15, -25). Let's find its slope: slope = (-25)/15 = -5/3. The slope of the original line is 5/3, and this direction vector's slope is -5/3, which is negative. So, it's a different slope, meaning it's a line going in the opposite direction. Therefore, even though the point is correct, the direction vector is not aligned with the original line.\n\nBut wait, could a direction vector have a negative slope and still lie on the original line? Let me think. No, because the direction vector must be parallel to the line, meaning same or opposite direction. So, a direction vector of (-15, 25) would have a slope of 25/(-15) = -5/3, which is still opposite of the original line's slope. So, if the direction vector is negative, the line is going in the opposite direction, but it's still parallel. So, does that mean it's a valid parameterization?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me recall that the direction vector can be any vector that is parallel to the line, regardless of direction. So, as long as the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector, regardless of sign.\n\nSo, the original line's slope is 5/3, so its direction vector can be (1, 5/3) or any scalar multiple. But option E's direction vector is (15, -25), which is a scalar multiple of (3, -5). Let me see if (3, -5) is a scalar multiple of (1, 5/3). Let me compute: if we scale (1, 5/3) by 3, we get (3, 5). Hmm, that's not equal to (3, -5). Alternatively, is (15, -25) a scalar multiple of (3, 5)? 15/3=5, but -25/5=-5. So, the scalar multiples are different signs. So, (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5) or (1,5/3). Therefore, the direction vector is not parallel to the original line. Hence, the parameterization is of a different line, not the given one.\n\nAlternatively, to check if the direction vectors are scalar multiples, direction vector of line: (3,5) or (1,5/3). Direction vector of E: (15, -25). Is (15, -25) = k*(3,5) for some k? 15=3k =>k=5, but then -25=5*5=25≠-25. So, no. Therefore, direction vector is not a scalar multiple. Hence, option E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only options A and C are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C, so the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it just says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, maybe I should combine them as A, C? In the required format, the user said \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", so I should write \\boxed{A,C}.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me recall that in the answer, each correct option is given as a letter, so if multiple, just separated by commas. So, yes, it's A and C.\n\nBut let me double-check once more. Let me take each option again:\n\nOption A: Point (4,1) is on the line, and direction vector slope 5/3 is correct. So, yes, valid.\n\nOption C: Point (2, -7/3) is on the line, direction vector slope 5/3, correct. So, yes, valid.\n\nOptions B, D, E: either the point isn't on the line or the direction vector's slope is incorrect. So, those are invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations correctly represent the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: whether the given point lies on the line and whether the direction vector has the correct slope.\n\n- **Option A**: The point \\((4, 1)\\) is on the line because substituting \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(y = 1\\). The direction vector \\((-3, -5)\\) has a slope of \\(\\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\\), which matches the line's slope. Therefore, option A is valid.\n\n- **Option B**: The point \\((17, 5)\\) is not on the line because substituting \\(x = 17\\) gives \\(y = \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.666\\), not 5. Therefore, option B is invalid.\n\n- **Option C**: The point \\((2, -\\frac{7}{3})\\) is on the line because substituting \\(x = 2\\) gives \\(y = -\\frac{7}{3}\\). The direction vector \\((\\frac{3}{5}, 1)\\) has a slope of \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{5}{3}\\), which matches the line's slope. Therefore, option C is valid.\n\n- **Option D**: The point \\((\\frac{14}{5}, -1)\\) is on the line because substituting \\(x = \\frac{14}{5}\\) gives \\(y = -1\\). However, the direction vector \\((1, \\frac{3}{5})\\) has a slope of \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), which does not match the line's slope of \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\). Therefore, option D is invalid.\n\n- **Option E**: The point \\((0, -\\frac{17}{3})\\) is on the line because substituting \\(x = 0\\) gives \\(y = -\\frac{17}{3}\\). However, the direction vector \\((15, -25)\\) has a slope of \\(\\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3}\\), which does not match the line's slope of \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\). Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A, C}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations (A to E) are valid for the line described by the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay. Let me recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form is usually given by a point on the line plus a direction vector multiplied by a parameter t. So, to check if a parameterization is valid, two things should be true: first, the point when t=0 should lie on the line, and second, the direction vector should be a direction vector for the line.\n\nLet me think about how to check each one. For each option, I can plug t=0 into the parameterization and see if the resulting point (x, y) satisfies the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Then, I also need to verify that the direction vector of the parameterization is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the given line.\n\nWait, first, I need to figure out the direction vector of the given line. The equation is in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope. The slope is 5/3, which is the same as the direction vector's rise over run. So, for a direction vector, I can use (3, 5) because rise is 5 and run is 3. That would mean any scalar multiple of (3,5) is a valid direction vector for the line.\n\nBut looking at the options, the direction vectors are given. So, I can check whether each direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3,5). Alternatively, I can calculate the slope from the direction vector and see if it's equal to 5/3. Let me do that for each option.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to substitute t=0 into each parameterization and see if the point lies on the given line, and then check if the direction vector is consistent with the line's slope. I think that's what I'll do.\n\nSo, let me take each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nParameterization:\n[x; y] = [4; 1] + t[-3; -5]\n\nFirst, when t=0, the point is (4,1). Let me check if this lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nPlug x=4 into the equation: y should be (5/3)*4 - 17/3. Let's compute that:\n\n(5/3)*4 = 20/3. 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So, yes, when x=4, y=1, which is exactly the point given. So the point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. Direction vector is (-3, -5). Let's see the slope of this vector. The slope would be rise over run, which is -5 / -3 = 5/3. Which is the same as the slope of the given line. So the direction vector is correct.\n\nTherefore, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\nParameterization:\n[x; y] = [17; 5] + t[6; 10]\n\nFirst, plug in t=0: (17,5). Let's check if this lies on the line.\n\nCompute y using x=17: (5/3)*17 -17/3.\n\nCalculate (5/3)*17: 85/3. Subtract 17/3: 68/3. 68 divided by 3 is approximately 22.666..., but the y-coordinate is 5 when x=17. Hmm, 5 is 15/3, which is 5. 68/3 is much larger. So 5 vs 68/3? 68/3 is about 22.666, so 5 is way off.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I did the calculation wrong.\n\nWait, wait, let me recompute y:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nWhen x =17, y = (5/3)*17 -17/3.\n\nWhich is (5*17)/3 -17/3 = (85 -17)/3 = 68/3 ≈22.666.\n\nBut the y-coordinate given is 5, which is nowhere near 22.666. So that point is not on the line. Therefore, option B is invalid because the point when t=0 is not on the line.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computation:\n\n(5/3)*17 is (5*17)/3 = 85/3. Then subtract 17/3: 85/3 -17/3=68/3=22 and 2/3≈22.666. Yes, that's correct. So y=5 is way off. So point is not on the line. Hence, invalid.\n\nTherefore, option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\nParameterization:\n[x; y] = [2; -7/3] + t[3/5; 1]\n\nFirst, plug in t=0: (2, -7/3). Check if this lies on the line y = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nCompute y when x=2: y = (5/3)*2 -17/3= 10/3 -17/3= (-7)/3. Which is -7/3. So, yes, (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector [3/5; 1]. What's the slope here? Rise over run: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. Which is equal to the slope of the given line, so the direction vector is valid.\n\nTherefore, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:**\nParameterization:\n[x; y] = [14/5; -1] + t[1; 3/5]\n\nFirst, plug in t=0: (14/5, -1). Check if this is on the line.\n\nCompute y when x=14/5: y=(5/3)*(14/5) -17/3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5/3)*(14/5) = (14)/3. Then subtract 17/3: 14/3 -17/3= (-3)/3= -1. So y= -1 when x=14/5. So, yes, (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nNow check the direction vector: [1; 3/5]. Slope is (3/5)/1=3/5. Wait, but the slope of the given line is 5/3. 3/5 is the reciprocal. So that's not equal. Hmm, so the direction vector's slope is 3/5, which is different from 5/3, which is the slope of the line.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see: direction vector is [1; 3/5], which is run 1, rise 3/5. So slope is (3/5)/1=3/5. That's the slope of the direction vector. But the given line has slope 5/3.\n\nHmm, so the direction vector's slope is different. Therefore, the direction vector is not consistent with the line. So the parameterization is invalid because the direction is wrong.\n\nBut hold on, maybe direction vector [1; 3/5] is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the line. Let me check if [1; 3/5] is a scalar multiple of [3;5].\n\nIf I multiply [3;5] by 1/15, we get [3*(1/15);5*(1/15)] = [1/5;1/3]. Which is not [1; 3/5]. Alternatively, is there a scalar k such that [1; 3/5] = k[3;5]?\n\nThat would require 1=3k and 3/5=5k. From the first equation, k=1/3. Then, substitute into second equation: 3/5=5*(1/3)=5/3. But 3/5 is not equal to 5/3. So no, it's not a scalar multiple. Therefore, direction vector is not correct. Hence, option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\nParameterization:\n[x; y] = [0; -17/3] + t[15; -25]\n\nFirst, plug t=0: (0, -17/3). Check if this is on the line.\n\nCompute y when x=0: y=(5/3)*0 -17/3 = 0 -17/3= -17/3. Which matches the y-coordinate. So, yes, point is on the line.\n\nNext, direction vector is [15; -25]. Let's check the slope: rise over run is (-25)/15 = -5/3. But the slope of the given line is 5/3. Hmm, the slope is negative, while the given line has positive slope. Additionally, -5/3 is the negative reciprocal of 3/5, not 5/3. So, clearly, the direction vector's slope is not 5/3. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, [15; -25]: slope is -25/15 = -5/3. The given line has slope 5/3. So, it's the negative of that. So, unless there's a miscalculation, it's not the same.\n\nTherefore, direction vector is incorrect. So, this parameterization is invalid because it doesn't follow the slope of the line.\n\nWait, but could it be a direction vector in the opposite direction? Because lines extend infinitely in both directions, so technically, if the direction vector is scalar multiple, positive or negative, both would lie on the same line.\n\nWait, but here, the slope is -5/3. But the given line has slope 5/3. So, it's a different slope. Thus, even though it's just the negative of the required slope, it's not the same slope, meaning it's a different line. Therefore, the direction is incorrect, so parameterization is invalid.\n\nSo, only options A and C are valid.\n\nWait, let me double-check, just in case.\n\nFor Option E, direction vector is [15; -25]. If we reduce that, divide numerator and denominator by 5, we get [3; -5]. Slope is -5/3. So yeah, same as before.\n\nWait, wait. If the slope is negative, does that matter? Because if the direction vector has a negative slope, and the line has a positive slope, that's not the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the direction vector for Option E. Maybe there was a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the direction vector given is [15; -25]. So, in vector terms, for each x you go 15, y decreases by 25. So, the direction is going to the right and downward. The given line is going to the right and upward, because slope is positive 5/3. So, the direction is opposite in terms of slope.\n\nThus, even though it's a scalar multiple in a way, the slope is negative. Hence, it's not a valid direction vector.\n\nTherefore, E is invalid.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the only valid parameterizations are options A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nSo, in the requested format, I should list them separated by commas inside the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two conditions for each parameterization: whether the point when \\( t = 0 \\) lies on the line and whether the direction vector has the same slope as the line.\n\n1. **Option A**:\n   - Parameterization: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Point when \\( t = 0 \\): (4, 1).

                "full_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations. The options are labeled (A) through (E), each representing a vector equation in terms of a parameter t. Hmm, okay. I remember that a parameterization of a line in two dimensions generally looks like this: a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, the format is usually \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{b}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector.\n\nFirst, I should check if each option is in that form. They all seem to be, so that's good. But now, I need to ensure that each parameterization is valid. I think the main things to check are two things: whether the given point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) lies on the line (which it does by definition because it's the point when t=0) and whether the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is correct for the line it's supposed to represent.\n\nWait, actually, hold on—the problem doesn't specify what lines we're parameterizing. Hmm, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. Oh, no, it just says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" without specifying a particular line. Hmm, so maybe the task is to verify if each given equation is a correct parameterization in general, assuming some line? Or perhaps I might need to verify something else, like whether the direction vector is parallel to the given line.\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's asking which of these are valid parametric equations, without any specific constraints. So, each of these is a line in two dimensions parameterized as a point plus a direction vector times t. In that case, all of them would be valid parameterizations of some line, because as long as the point is on the line and the direction vector is consistent, it's a valid parameterization. But maybe I need to check if they actually represent lines in the plane correctly. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the original problem was supposed to list multiple lines and ask which parameterizations correspond to which lines, but in this case, it's just asking for valid parameterizations without reference to specific lines. Maybe it's just about whether the format is correct—so if it's in the form point plus scalar times direction vector, it's a valid parameterization. But looking at all the options, they all fit that form.\n\nWait, hold on—maybe the issue is whether the direction vector and the point are in the same plane. All of them are in two dimensions, so they should all be valid. Unless, perhaps, the direction vectors are zero vectors, which would make the parameterization invalid because it wouldn't trace a line—it would just be a single point.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of the direction vectors are zero vectors. All of them have non-zero components. For example, (A) has direction vector (-3, -5), which is fine. (B) is (6,10). (C) is (3/5,1). (D) is (1, 3/5). (E) is (15, -25). So, none of them are zero vectors, so they should all be valid parameterizations, tracing a line in the plane as t varies.\n\nWait, but maybe it's about whether they are non-redundant or not. Like, if two direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, they might represent the same line, but that's still a valid parameterization—it just parameterizes the line at a different speed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was supposed to be about whether the direction vectors are correctly scaled or normalized or something else. But no, without knowing the lines they are supposed to represent, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about whether the direction vectors are correct for the given systems of equations. But wait, the equations are given in parametric form, so each option is a parametric equation of a line. So, without additional constraints, any equation of the form point + t*dv is a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, unless there's a specific line that each is supposed to represent and we have to check if each parameterization is correct for that specific line.\n\nBut since the problem as stated doesn't specify which lines each parameterization is supposed to represent, maybe the question is just to recognize the format. Therefore, all options are in the correct format of a point plus t times a direction vector, making them all valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, is that necessarily the case? Let me think.\n\nNo, hold on—the direction vectors have to be consistent with the lines that the equations are supposed to represent. But since the problem doesn't specify which line each is supposed to represent, maybe each parameterization is valid in the sense that they can represent any line.\n\nBut actually, in the problem, all these equations are parameterizations, but perhaps the question is whether the direction vectors are correctly normalized or scaled with respect to some other property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a larger context where it's asking if the parameterizations correspond to certain systems of equations or something else, but in this case, we have just parameterizations.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether they can be rewritten in the form y = mx + b or something, but since they're already parametric, that might not be the case.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here because without specific constraints, it's unclear what makes one valid and another not. But since all the equations are in the form point plus t times direction vector, they are all valid parameterizations, right? Because the format is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each of these is a possible parametrization of the same line or something else, but I think the problem is just asking for the recognition that each one is a valid parameterization.\n\nBut wait, the problem is presented as \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So maybe each one is either a valid or invalid parameterization for some specific reason.\n\nBut wait, given that they're all in the correct form, if no specific line is given, they're all valid. However, perhaps for each one, we need to check if they correctly represent some line. But without additional information, I don't think we can determine that. Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether the direction vectors are correct for given equations, but as the equations are given, we can't tell.\n\nWait a second, maybe each of these options is presented with a system of equations that was not included here, and this problem is a continuation. But as given, in the prompt, all we have is these five parameterizations, and the question is \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So perhaps in the original source, there was a corresponding system of equations, and these are the possible parameterizations. But since we don't have that context, we can't know.\n\nHmm, now I'm doubting. Maybe the direction vectors are incorrect because, for example, in (A), it's given as direction vector (-3, -5), but perhaps if it's supposed to represent a different line, that might be invalid. But without knowing which line it's supposed to represent, we can't say. So perhaps it's a trick question where all of them are valid because they are correctly in the form of point + t*dv.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is whether the direction vectors are correct for the given parametric equations of a line in the plane.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe each of these is a vector equation that's given, and we can check if the direction vectors are consistent.\n\nBut to do that, we might need more information, such as if they are solutions to a system of equations, but without that, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the existence of some solution for x and y for each parameterization, which is trivially true because it's a line, but that's not useful.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe the question is referring to whether each option correctly expresses the line as per standard conventions, such as not having fractions in the direction vector or something else.\n\nLooking at option (C): the direction vector is (3/5, 1). It has a fraction, but unless the direction vector is supposed to be in integers or something, which is not specified, so fractions are acceptable. Similarly, (D) has (1, 3/5)—same idea.\n\nOption (E) has direction vector (15, -25). That can be simplified by dividing by 5 to get (3, -5), which is a simpler direction vector.\n\nSo perhaps option (E) is a valid parameterization because 15 and -25 have a common factor of 5, so the direction vector can be written as 5*(3, -5), so it's a valid parameterization because it's just scaled by 5. Whereas, maybe the others don't have such common factors?\n\nWait, (A): (-3, -5) is a direction vector. That's already in simplest form, I think.\n\n(B): (6, 10). That's also reducible by dividing by 2 to get (3,5). So, (B) could be written as t*(6,10), which is same as 2t*(3,5). So, it's a valid parameterization as well.\n\n(C): (3/5,1) cannot be simplified without fractions, so it's okay.\n\n(D): (1, 3/5). Similarly, this can't be simplified without fractions, so it's okay.\n\n(E): (15, -25) simplifies to (3, -5), so it's just scaled by 5.\n\nSo, unless the direction vector is supposed to be in a certain form, such as integer components with no common factor, then (E) is acceptable because it can be scaled down. So perhaps all options are valid, because they can be adjusted to have integer components if needed.\n\nBut the question is about \"valid parameterizations.\" Since all of them are in the correct format, I think they are all valid. So maybe all options (A) through (E) are valid. But let me check the original question again: \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So the options are (A) through (E), and I have to select all that apply.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's a trick because one of the direction vectors is a zero vector or something? Let me check again:\n\n(A) direction vector (-3, -5): not zero.\n\n(B) direction vector (6,10): not zero.\n\n(C) direction vector (3/5,1): not zero.\n\n(D) direction vector (1, 3/5): not zero.\n\n(E) direction vector (15, -25): not zero.\n\nSo none of them have zero vectors. All are valid in that sense. So, why is this a question? Maybe because some direction vectors might be inconsistent with the given point? Hmm.\n\nFor example, in option (C): the point is (2, -7/3) and the direction vector is (3/5,1). So, as t varies, does this trace a line? Yes, because parametric equations just require the point and the direction vector. So, all of them are lines in 2D space. Therefore, they are all valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, then why does the question exist? It must be that each parameterization corresponds to a specific line, but since the lines are not specified, we just have to recognize that the parameterizations are correct.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the direction vector is required to be a unit vector, but that's not specified here. So unless told, a direction vector can be any non-zero vector, so (E) is acceptable as a direction vector even though it's not a unit vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are to be in a certain form, such as y = mx + b, but these are parametric equations, so perhaps each corresponds to different lines.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about whether the given parametric equations correctly correspond to some system of equations. But without knowing the systems, I can't tell. So, without more context, perhaps all of them are valid.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is in Chinese? The user prompt was in Chinese. Maybe translation issues? Let me check the original.\n\nWait, the user hasn't specified the original problem—it's just the problem statement provided in English. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe this is part of a multiple-step problem, but the way it's presented is that options are given, so likely in the original, each of these is a possible parameterization, and the question is which are valid.\n\nBut unless given specific constraints, all of them are valid. So maybe all options are correct. But that's 5 letters. Maybe it's not all of them. Let me think of another angle.\n\nPerhaps the direction vectors have to have components that are either 0 or non-zero? Well, all of them are non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vectors can't be scalar multiples of each other? But (B) and (E) are scalar multiples: (6,10) is 2*(3,5), which is similar to (E)'s simplified direction vector.\n\nBut that doesn't make a parameterization invalid. It just means that (B) is parameterizing the same line as (E) but at a different speed.\n\nBut wait, unless for a specific line, parameterizations have to be of a specific form, but since no lines are given, we can't tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is with the point being on the line or not.\n\nWait, but unless the problem mentions a specific line, such as whether the point is on a particular line, we can't say.\n\nWait, maybe it's a coordinate-wise parameterization. For example, in (A), x = 4 and y =1 + t*(-5). So, is this a valid parameterization for some line?\n\nYes, because it represents a vertical line x=4, parameterized by t. Similarly, in (B), x=17 +6t, y=5 +10t, which represents a line with direction vector (6,10). So, in that case, unless (A) or (B) is supposed to represent horizontal or vertical lines, but since it's not specified, it's still a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the problem is saying \"which of the following are valid parameterizations\" for a specific line. But since that specific line isn't given, but only five parameterizations, the answer would be all of them. But the problem didn't specify any particular line, so I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if each parameterization correctly satisfies some given parametric equations.\n\nWait, but again, the way it's given is only five parameterizations. Unless each is presented against a system of equations, which isn't here.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps each of these is a possible correct parameterization of some line in the plane, so unless there's a reason to discard any of them, all are valid. So maybe the answer is all of them.\n\nBut that seems too broad—probably, in the original problem, each of these is a parameterization of a specific line, and you have to check each one against its given system of equations. But without that context, it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem in Chinese was about a system of equations, and these parameterizations correspond to different solutions or something. But without the original Chinese text, I can't confirm.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe it's about the dimension. All these are in two dimensions, so they are all valid. Maybe in three dimensions, but they aren't. So all are 2D parameterizations, so all valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is whether each parameterization correctly starts at a specific point. For example, if a line is supposed to pass through a certain point at t=0, but unless given, we can't say.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the continuity or differentiability, but that's too calculus-heavy and not relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe each of these is the solution to a system of equations, and the question is about which parameterizations satisfy the system.\n\nBut again, since we don't have the system, we can't determine.\n\nWait, given that all these are presented as parameterizations without any constraints, I think the answer is that all are valid. So, in that case, the answer is options (A) through (E), all correct. So I would enter all letters separated by commas.\n\nBut wait, the system prompt mentions \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, maybe it's not necessarily all. Maybe some are not because they have direction vectors with zero components or something else. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at (A): direction vector (-3, -5). Fine.\n\n(B): (6, 10). Fine.\n\n(C): (3/5, 1). Fine.\n\n(D): (1, 3/5). Fine.\n\n(E): (15, -25). Fine.\n\nAll are non-zero, so all are valid.\n\nWait, then why does the question ask \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" If all are valid, then the answer is all. But I think it's more likely that not all are valid because maybe the direction vectors have issues. But I can't see any issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that some direction vectors are not perpendicular or something. Wait, but without knowing, we can't say.\n\nWait, if we think of a line in two dimensions, it can be parameterized with any point on the line and any direction vector. So, if all these options are points on a line with a valid direction vector, then they are all valid. But again, since we don't know the lines, we can't say. So unless there's more context, all are valid.\n\nWait, maybe it's a question where it's multiple choice, so options are given, but in this case, the user hasn't provided the options. So, based on the problem as given, it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about correctness given a specific line, but since we aren't given which line each is supposed to represent, we can't tell. So in the absence of specific constraints, maybe all are correct.\n\nBut I'm starting to second-guess. Let me consider that perhaps a parameterization is only valid if the direction vector is a unit vector, but since that's not stated in the problem, we can't assume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some direction vectors have denominators, but that's standard in mathematics.\n\nWait, actually, in linear algebra, a parameterization as long as it's point plus scalar times direction vector is valid. So, if all these options follow that, they are all valid.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but that seems too confident. Maybe I should verify with an example. Let's pick option (C): \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nSo, x",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations. The options are labeled from A to E, and each one is a vector equation that presumably represents a line in 2D space. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a parameterization of a line in 2D typically looks like. From what I remember, a parameterization usually consists of two parts: a point on the line and a direction vector. So, it's something like:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is the position vector of a point on the line, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector that indicates the slope of the line. The parameter \\(t\\) is a real number that scales the direction vector, allowing the point \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\) to move along the line as \\(t\\) varies.\n\nSo, to determine if each option is a valid parameterization, I should check two main things for each:\n\n1. **Point Check**: Does the given equation have a specific point on the line? That is, when \\(t = 0\\), does it provide a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) on the line? \n2. **Direction Vector Check**: Is the direction vector non-zero? If the direction vector is the zero vector, then it's not a valid parameterization because the line would not be defined (it would be a single point regardless of \\(t\\)).\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- **Point Check**: When \\(t = 0\\), the point is \\((4, 1)\\). That looks good.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is not the zero vector. So, that's fine.\nTherefore, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- **Point Check**: At \\(t = 0\\), the point is \\((17, 5)\\). Seems fine.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is also non-zero.\nHence, Option B is valid.\n\n**Option C:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- **Point Check**: At \\(t = 0\\), it's \\((2, -7/3)\\). That looks okay.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is definitely not the zero vector.\nSo, Option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- **Point Check**: When \\(t = 0\\), we have \\((14/5, -1)\\), which is a specific point. Good.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is not zero.\nThus, Option D is also a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option E:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- **Point Check**: At \\(t = 0\\), it's \\((0, -17/3)\\). That's a valid point.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Not zero. So, it's valid.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me re-examine each option more carefully, just to make sure I haven't made a mistake. It's easy to overlook something when working through all options.\n\nStarting with Option A: It starts at (4,1), direction (-3, -5). Seems fine. The direction vector is non-zero, so A is valid.\n\nOption B: Starts at (17,5), direction (6,10). Both non-zero. Valid.\n\nOption C: Starts at (2, -7/3), direction (3/5, 1). All non-zero. Valid.\n\nOption D: Starts at (14/5, -1), direction (1, 3/5). Non-zero, valid.\n\nOption E: Starts at (0, -17/3), direction (15, -25). Again, all non-zero. Seems good. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something here. Are all these direction vectors correct? It seems so. Each direction vector is a 2D vector with two non-zero components or at least not all zero. So, all five are okay?\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because sometimes people give parameterizations that might inadvertently be representing lines, but perhaps they might have mistakenly used the same point or something else. Maybe I need to check if they actually define lines that pass through the given points or something.\n\nWait, no. The primary thing is that the parameterizations are correct in terms of being linear equations in t. Each is of the form p0 + t*v, so each is a line. So as long as the direction vector is non-zero, and a point is provided, then it's a valid parameterization.\n\nTherefore, all options A to E are valid parameterizations because each has a specific point and a non-zero direction vector.\n\nWait, hold on again. Because actually, when t is any real number, all these parameterizations do define lines. So, unless they have some constraints that are being missed here, but the question is just about valid parameterizations.\n\nIs there any chance that any of these have a direction vector of zero? Let's double-check each direction vector.\n\n- A: -3 and -5, both non-zero. Okay.\n- B: 6 and 10, both non-zero. Fine.\n- C: 3/5 and 1, both non-zero. Good.\n- D: 1 and 3/5, both non-zero. No problem.\n- E: 15 and -25, both non-zero. So, all direction vectors are valid.\n\nThus, all options A through E are valid parameterizations because each has a point and a non-zero direction vector.\n\nWait, but just to confirm, sometimes people might think that in option C, the second component is -7/3, but since it's a 2D vector, having a fractional component is okay. Similarly, in E, direction vector is (15, -25), which is just 15 and -25, non-zero.\n\nTherefore, I think all of them are correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about something else. Maybe, is there a direction vector that is incorrect for the initial point? Like, perhaps the direction vector is not consistent with the line? But no, the direction vector is independent of the point; it's just the slope of the line. So, as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it's a valid line.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that all options A, B, C, D, E are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Wait a minute!** Hold on. I just recalled that sometimes parameterizations are considered valid only if the direction vector is consistent with the line passing through the point, but actually, the parameterization represents the line irrespective of the direction vector's slope, because the direction vector defines the direction, which includes the slope. So, as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it's a valid line.\n\nWait, maybe no. Perhaps each of these is a different parameterization of a unique line, so as long as the point is on the line, and the direction vector is non-zero, then each is a valid parameterization of its respective line.\n\nTherefore, since all of them meet the criteria, A, B, C, D, E are all valid.\n\nBut hold on, I'm feeling a bit unsure. Let me check again with the coordinates.\n\nWait, if I consider that a parameterization with direction vector (a,b) can also be expressed with any scalar multiple of (a,b). But in these options, each has a different direction vector, so they are different lines with different slopes or same slopes?\n\nWait, if you have different direction vectors, as long as they represent the same line, then multiple parameterizations are possible. But in this case, I don't think they are the same line.\n\nLet me check the equations of the lines.\n\nStarting with each parameterization, we can write the equation of the line.\n\nFor a parameterization:\n\n\\[\nx = x_0 + at\n\\]\n\\[\ny = y_0 + bt\n\\]\n\nTo get the equation of the line, we can eliminate t.\n\nFor example, from x: t = (x - x0)/a, assuming a ≠ 0.\n\nThen plug into y: y = y0 + b*( (x - x0)/a )\n\nSo, the equation is y = (b/a)(x - x0) + y0.\n\nSimilarly, if a is zero, then x = x0, which is a vertical line.\n\nSo, let me find the equations of each line:\n\n**Option A:**\nx = 4 - 3t\ny = 1 - 5t\n\nFrom x: t = (x - 4)/(-3) = (4 - x)/3\nPlug into y: y = 1 -5*( (4 - x)/3 ) = 1 - (20 -5x)/3 = (3 -20 +5x)/3 = (-17 +5x)/3\nSo, y = (5x -17)/3 or y = (5/3)x -17/3\n\nSo, that's a line with slope 5/3.\n\n**Option B:**\nx =17 +6t\ny =5 +10t\n\nFrom x: t = (x -17)/6\nPlug into y: y =5 +10*( (x -17)/6 ) =5 + (10x -170)/6 = (30 +10x -170)/6 = (10x -140)/6 = (5x -70)/3\n\nSo, equation is y = (5x -70)/3 or y = (5/3)x -70/3\n\nSlope is 5/3, same as Option A.\n\n**Option C:**\nx =2 + (3/5)t\ny =-7/3 + t\n\nSolve for t from x: t = (x -2)*(5/3)\nPlug into y: y = -7/3 + (x -2)*(5/3)\n= -7/3 + (5x -10)/3\n= ( -7 +5x -10 )/3\n= (5x -17)/3\n\nEquation is y = (5x -17)/3, same as A and B.\n\nSlope is 5/3.\n\n**Option D:**\nx =14/5 + t\ny = -1 + (3/5)t\n\nSolve for t from x: t = x -14/5\nPlug into y: y = -1 + (3/5)*(x -14/5) = -1 + (3x/5 -42/25)\nConvert -1 to -25/25: So, -25/25 -42/25 +3x/5 = (3x)/5 -67/25\n\nSo, equation is y = (3/5)x -67/25\n\nWhich simplifies to: multiply numerator and denominator:\n\n3x/5 -67/25. So, slope is 3/5.\n\n**Option E:**\nx =0 +15t\ny =-17/3 + (-25)t\n\nSo, x =15t, so t = x/15\n\nPlug into y: y = -17/3 -25*(x/15) = -17/3 - (5x)/3\n\nSimplify: y = (-5x)/3 -17/3\n\nSo, equation is y = (-5/3)x -17/3\n\nWhich is a slope of -5/3.\n\nTherefore, now, putting together the equations:\n\n- A, B, C: same line, slope 5/3\n- D: slope 3/5\n- E: slope -5/3\n\nSo, each parameterization corresponds to a unique line, either with slope 5/3, 3/5, or -5/3.\n\nSince each is a different line, each of their parameterizations is valid as long as the direction vector is non-zero, which they all are. So, each of A through E is a valid parameterization of their respective lines.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Because the question is only asking \"which of the following options are valid parameterizations\", without specifying whether they represent the same line or different lines.\n\nBut since each parameterization is individually correct as a parameterization of its own line, so each is valid.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that one of them might represent the same line but with a different parameterization, thereby invalidating it? No, because each one starts at a different point and has a different direction vector, so they're different lines.\n\nThus, all are valid.\n\nWait, but then why do we have options A, B, C, D, E? Since all are correct, but it's an unusual set. Maybe I did a mistake in computing their equations.\n\nWait, I should recheck.\n\n**Rechecking Option D:**\n\nx =14/5 + t\ny =-1 + (3/5)t\n\nFrom x: t = x -14/5\n\nThen y = -1 + (3/5)(x -14/5) = -1 + (3x/5 - 42/25) = convert -1 to -25/25:\n\n-25/25 + (-42/25) + 3x/5 = (3x/5 -67/25).

So, slope -5/3. Correct.\n\nSo, no, none of them have same direction vectors or starting points that would cause issues. So, each is unique in their parameterization, but each is correct.\n\nTherefore, all options A through E are valid.\n\nBut the question is a bit confusing, as sometimes in multiple-choice questions, you might only have to pick the ones that are parameterizations of the same line, but here it's just parameterizations in general, without any reference.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that all options A, B, C, D, E are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations, we need to check two main things for each: the point on the line and the direction vector.\n\n1. **Point Check**: Verify if the given equation provides a specific point when \\( t = 0 \\).\n2. **Direction Vector Check**: Ensure the direction vector is non-zero.\n\nEach option is of the form:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) is the direction vector.\n\n**Option A:**\n- Point at \\( t = 0 \\): \\((4, 1)\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n- Valid\n\n**Option B:**\n- Point at \\( t = 0 \\): \\((17, 5)\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n- Valid\n\n**Option C:**\n- Point at \\( t = 0 \\): \\((2, -7/3)\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n- Valid\n\n**Option D:**\n- Point at \\( t = 0 \\): \\((14/5, -1)\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n- Valid\n\n**Option E:**\n- Point at \\( t = 0 \\): \\((0, -17/3)\\)\n- Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\) (non-zero)\n- Valid\n\nEach option has a valid point and a non-zero direction vector, so all are valid parameterizations.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations. The options are labeled from (A) to (E), each representing a parameterized vector equation in two dimensions. I remember that a parameterization of a line in 2D is generally given by a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, each of these should represent a line, but I need to verify if they're correctly formed.\n\nLet me break down what I need to check for each option:\n\n1. **Point Check**: The vector before the plus sign should give a point on the line. This means the coordinates should be specific numbers, not variables or expressions involving parameters.\n2. **Direction Vector Check**: The vector multiplied by the parameter t should be a direction vector. It can be any non-zero vector, as long as it's consistent and doesn't depend on t.\n\nSo, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n- **Point Check**: The point is (4, 1). That's fixed; no variables, so it's fine.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is (-3, -5). This is a constant vector, so it's valid.\n\nTherefore, (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n- **Point Check**: The point is (17, 5). That's specific, so good.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is (6, 10). It's a constant vector.\n\n(B) seems valid too.\n\n**Option (C):**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n- **Point Check**: The point is (2, -7/3). Again, both components are specific numbers, so it's fine.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The direction vector is (3/5, 1). It's a constant vector with fractions, but that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, (C) is valid.\n\n**Option (D):**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n- **Point Check**: (14/5, -1). The x-component is a fraction, but still specific, so that's okay.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: The vector is (1, 3/5). Again, it's a fixed direction.\n\n(D) looks good as well.\n\n**Option (E):**\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n- **Point Check**: (0, -17/3). Fixed numbers, so good.\n- **Direction Vector Check**: (15, -25). This is a vector, but we should ensure that it's a direction vector, not zero.\n\nHere, the direction vector isn't zero, so it's fine.\n\nWait, but hold on. I need to make sure that the direction vectors in all options are correct. Let me double-check each one just to be thorough.\n\nFor (A): Yes, (-3, -5) is fine.\n\nFor (B): (6,10) is okay.\n\nFor (C): (3/5,1) is fine.\n\nFor (D): (1, 3/5) is correct.\n\nFor (E): (15, -25) is non-zero.\n\nSo, is there any reason to doubt any of these?\n\nHmm, another thing I remember is that in some cases, direction vectors can have issues if they are colinear or something, but no, that doesn't affect validity. A parameterization just needs a point and a direction. They can be colinear if you scale them, but since t is a parameter, it's still the same line.\n\nSo, perhaps all these options are valid.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any of the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, which would make them represent the same line.\n\nLooking at (A): (-3, -5)\n\n(B): (6, 10) which is exactly -2 times (A)'s direction vector.\n\nSo, (A) and (B) both represent the same line but with different direction vectors. But the question is about validity, not uniqueness. So both (A) and (B) are valid, even if they parameterize the same line.\n\nBut the question just asks for valid parameterizations, not necessarily unique. So, both (A) and (B) are correct.\n\nWait, but does the point lie on the line when t=0? For example, in (A), at t=0, it's (4,1). If (B) is parameterizing the same line, does (17,5) lie on the line?\n\nLet me verify that. The line from (A) is (4,1) + t(-3,-5). If I set t=2, for example:\n\nx = 4 - 6 = -2\n\ny = 1 -10 = -9\n\nSo the point (-2, -9) is on both lines. Let's see if (17,5) can be achieved from (4,1):\n\n17 = 4 - 3t => t = (4 -17)/3 = (-13)/3\n\n5 = 1 -5t => t = (1 -5)/(-5) = (-4)/(-5)= 4/5\n\nBut t can't be both -13/3 and 4/5. Wait, that suggests that perhaps (17,5) isn't on the same line as (4,1) with direction (-3,-5). Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nCompute whether (17,5) is on the line through (4,1) with direction (-3,-5):\n\nThe parametric equations are:\n\nx = 4 - 3t\n\ny = 1 -5t\n\nSo, suppose (x, y) = (17,5). Then,\n\n17 = 4 -3t => 13 = -3t => t = -13/3\n\nAnd\n\n5 = 1 -5t => 4 = -5t => t = -4/5\n\nSo, t is different in both cases. Therefore, (17,5) is not on the same line as (4,1) with direction (-3,-5). Therefore, (B) is actually parameterizing a different line.\n\nBut is that a problem for its validity as a parameterization? No, because it's still a valid parameterization for its own line.\n\nSo, if a question is asking for parameterizations, whether they represent the same line or different lines is irrelevant. Each one is a valid parameterization as long as it follows the point and direction vector correctly.\n\nTherefore, (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) are all valid parameterizations, as each has a point and a direction vector. So, is that correct?\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the direction vectors are not zero vectors, but all of them except maybe E, let me check:\n\n(A): (-3,-5) is not zero.\n\n(B): (6,10) not zero.\n\n(C): (3/5,1) not zero.\n\n(D): (1, 3/5) not zero.\n\n(E): (15, -25) not zero.\n\nTherefore, yes, all have non-zero direction vectors.\n\nTherefore, all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure if any have fractions or anything, but since parameterizations can have any real numbers, including fractions and decimals, that's fine.\n\nSo, all five options are valid.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because usually such questions in exams have some incorrect options, but maybe in this case, all are correct.\n\nAlternatively, is there a chance that I may have misread one of the options? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n(A) is correct.\n\n(B) is correct.\n\n(C) is correct.\n\n(D) is correct.\n\n(E) is correct.\n\nHmm, so unless I made a mistake in thinking.\n\nWait, for (E), the point is (0, -17/3). Let me see if maybe the direction vector is (15, -25), which can be simplified as 5*(3, -5). So, perhaps someone might get confused if direction vectors are same. But since t is a scalar parameter, scaling the direction vector doesn't make it invalid.\n\nSimilarly, (A) has direction vector (-3, -5), and (B) is (6,10)= -2*( -3, -5). So, same line, just different direction vectors. So, both (A) and (B) are correct.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nIs there any other possible issue?\n\nWait, sometimes, when you have a parameterization, you might have to ensure that the point is indeed on the line when t=0, but that's already given.\n\nSo, all of them satisfy that.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that all options from (A) to (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut just to make 100% sure, I want to test one more thing: if the direction vector can be expressed as another parameter, but unless it's scaled improperly.\n\nWait, direction vector is t multiplied by that vector, so as long as the direction vector is correct, regardless of scaling.\n\nSo, no, that's not a problem.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that all options are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, and \\boxed{E}.\n\nWait, the question says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, I need to list all letters without commas in a single box? No, the instructions say \"Enter the letters separated by commas.\" So, I need to list all five letters as A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut wait, hold on, just as a note, the initial problem says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" with options (A) through (E). So, is it possible that in my initial analysis, all are valid? Or perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about (B)?\n\nWait, no, because (B) is still a valid parameterization for its own line. The fact that (A) and (B) parameterize the same line is besides the point.\n\nSo, yes, all five are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n\nWait, I think the correct way is to enter them as a single box with all letters separated by commas. Let me check the exact instructions: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, it should be A,B,C,D,E inside the box.\n\nBut LaTeX in the box can handle multiple letters separated by commas, like \\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}.\n\nYes, so the final answer is \\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations, we need to check if each option represents a line in 2D, which requires a specific point and a non-zero direction vector.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- Point: (4, 1) is specific.\n- Direction vector: (-3, -5) is non-zero.\n\nValid.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- Point: (17, 5) is specific.\n- Direction vector: (6, 10) is non-zero.\n\nValid.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- Point: (2, -7/3) is specific.\n- Direction vector: (3/5, 1) is non-zero.\n\nValid.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- Point: (14/5, -1) is specific.\n- Direction vector: (1, 3/5) is non-zero.\n\nValid.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n- Point: (0, -17/3) is specific.\n- Direction vector: (15, -25) is non-zero.\n\nValid.\n\nAll options are valid parameterizations.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given options (A to E) are valid parameterizations. Hmm, I remember that a parameterization is basically a way to express a line in terms of a parameter, usually denoted as t. Each option seems to give a point and a direction vector, so I think these are all parametric equations for lines in 2D space. \n\nFirst, I should recall what makes a parameterization valid. I believe that for it to be a valid parameterization, the direction vector should not be the zero vector, and the point given should lie on the line defined by the parameterization. But wait, the point is already provided, so as long as the direction vector is not zero, it should be fine, right? Hmm, maybe more precisely, each parametric equation should correctly represent the line in terms of the direction and the point.\n\nSo let me think: in each option, we have a starting point (when t=0) and a direction vector multiplied by a parameter t. So for each option, as t varies over all real numbers, the point (x, y) should trace out a line. So, for all these to be valid, the direction vector just needs to be non-zero. Because if the direction vector is zero, then the parametric equations would just give the same point regardless of t, which doesn't really represent a line—it just gives a single point.\n\nTherefore, for all options, as long as the direction vector isn't the zero vector, they should be valid parameterizations. Let me check each direction vector:\n\nOption A: direction vector is (-3, -5). Definitely not zero.\n\nOption B: direction vector is (6, 10). Also not zero.\n\nOption C: direction vector is (3/5, 1). Also not zero.\n\nOption D: direction vector is (1, 3/5). Not zero either.\n\nOption E: direction vector is (15, -25). Also non-zero.\n\nSo all direction vectors are non-zero. Therefore, each of these parameterizations is valid because they give a starting point and a direction, with a direction vector that's not zero, so as t varies, they trace lines. \n\nWait, but hold on. Maybe I need to check if the point lies on the line? Hmm, but actually, each parameterization defines a line based on that point and direction vector, so the point is on the line by construction. So I think all of these are valid as long as the direction vector isn't zero. \n\nSince all direction vectors are non-zero in each option, all of them are valid. Hmm, so all letters A, B, C, D, E are valid. But let me think again: sometimes, people might impose certain restrictions, like the parameterization being in the simplest form or something, but here, they're just asking if the parameterization is valid, meaning they just need to represent a line.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a reason to discard any of them, they're all valid. But I remember in some problems, especially when considering lines in affine space, another condition comes into play—the parameterization must cover the entire line as t varies. However, as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it will indeed cover the entire line as t ranges over all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, I think all options A to E are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait a second, but in option C, the starting point is (2, -7/3) and the direction vector is (3/5, 1). Is there any reason this might not be valid? Hmm, if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of another vector, does that affect anything? Or maybe, is there a different starting point that would also represent the same line? Hmm, no, that's just another parameterization of the same line, which is valid as well.\n\nSimilarly for option E: starting point (0, -17/3) and direction vector (15, -25). I don't think that's a problem. The direction vector is just (15, -25); as long as it's non-zero, it's fine.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps in some cases, the direction vector could be zero, which we've already checked isn't the case here. So I think my initial conclusion is correct.\n\nSo yes, all options A through E are valid parameterizations. Therefore, the letters are A, B, C, D, E.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A, B, C, D, and E. So the answer is \\boxed{A,B,C,D,E}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations, we need to check if each option provides a correct representation of a line in 2D space. A valid parameterization must have a non-zero direction vector and correctly represent a line when the parameter \\( t \\) varies over all real numbers.\n\nEach option is of the form:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is a point on the line and \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) is the direction vector.\n\nWe need to check if the direction vector is non-zero for each option:\n\n- **Option A**: Direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is non-zero.\n- **Option B**: Direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is non-zero.\n- **Option C**: Direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is non-zero.\n- **Option D**: Direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is non-zero.\n- **Option E**: Direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is non-zero.\n\nSince all direction vectors are non-zero, each option is a valid parameterization of a line.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe valid parameterizations are options A, B, C, D, and E.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations are valid. Hmm, parameterization, that means we're expressing the coordinates x and y in terms of a parameter, probably t. From what I remember, a parameterization should satisfy the equation of the line it's supposed to represent. But wait, in these options, I see vectors and starting points. I think each one is in the form of a point plus t times a direction vector. So each is a parametric equation of a line. \n\nBut to be valid, maybe they just need to be correctly formed? Or do they have to lie on a specific line? Let me think. The problem doesn't specify a particular line, so maybe all these are valid as long as they are parameterizations of lines. But wait, maybe I need to check if the direction vectors are correct or something? Or perhaps the initial points?\n\nWait, actually, no. A parameterization of a line is generally given by a point on the line plus t times the direction vector. So as long as the direction vector is correct and the point is on the line, it's valid. But hold on, the problem just asks which are valid parameterizations without specifying a particular line. Hmm, so maybe any of them are valid as long as they are correct parameterizations of lines.\n\nBut wait, let's see: Do these all have direction vectors? Yes, each one has a direction vector. The starting point is given, so each is a line in vector form. Therefore, each one is a valid parameterization of a line. But then why does the question ask which are valid? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was presented in a different context. Maybe these are supposed to parameterize a specific line, but the equation isn't given. Alternatively, perhaps they were meant to be equations of lines and the problem is to check which of them are correct? Hmm. Without more context, it's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to see which of these have direction vectors that lie on a particular condition, or which ones might have issues with direction vectors or points. For instance, maybe direction vectors can't be zero vectors? But looking at the options, none of them have direction vectors that are zero vectors.\n\nLet me double-check each option:\n\nOption (A): Direction vector is [-3, -5]. That's fine. It's not a zero vector. Starting point is (4,1), which is somewhere on the plane.\n\nOption (B): Direction vector is [6,10]. Fine as well. Starting point is (17,5).\n\nOption (C): Direction vector is [3/5, 1]. Starting point is (2, -7/3). That seems okay.\n\nOption (D): Direction vector is [1, 3/5]. Starting point is (14/5, -1). Also fine.\n\nOption (E): Direction vector is [15, -25]. Starting point is (0, -17/3). Hmm, that direction vector, 15 and -25, is that a multiple of anything? Let me see: 15 and 25 can both be divided by 5. So 15/5=3, and -25/5=-5. So the direction vector simplifies to [3, -5]. So it's just a scaled version of the direction vector in option (A). \n\nBut wait, is that a problem? Well, no, because the direction vector can be any scalar multiple. So that's still a valid direction vector.\n\nBut wait, the initial point in (E) is (0, -17/3). If we plug in t=0, we get (0, -17/3). Is this point lying on the same line as the parameterization in (A)? Wait, maybe I need to check if these parameterizations lie on the same line or different lines. But the question didn't specify, so I think each one is just a parameterization of a different line, as long as it's correctly formed.\n\nBut then again, maybe they are parameterizations of the same line. If that's the case, then perhaps only one direction vector or scaling is allowed, but unless more context is given, I don't think so.\n\nWait, I think my initial thought is correct. Each option is a parameterization of a line, so all of them are valid. But maybe the question is testing whether direction vectors can be written in simplest form or something?\n\nWait, that could be it. For example, option (C) has a direction vector of [3/5, 1], while option (A) has [-3, -5]. Hmm, if we scale (A) by 1/5, we get [-3/5, -1], which is not the same as [3/5,1]. So unless direction vectors are required to be in a specific form, like integer components or something, then option (C) might be the same line as (A) scaled, but starting from a different point.\n\nWait, let's check if option (C)'s line is the same as option (A)'s line.\n\nFor option (A): The parametric equations are x = 4 - 3t, y = 1 -5t.\n\nFor option (C): x = 2 + (3/5)t, y = -7/3 + t.\n\nIs there a value of t1 for option (A) and t2 for option (C) such that their x and y coordinates match? Let's see:\n\nSet 4 - 3t1 = 2 + (3/5)t2\n\nand 1 - 5t1 = -7/3 + t2.\n\nSo we have a system:\n\nEquation 1: 4 - 3t1 - 2 = (3/5)t2 => 2 - 3t1 = (3/5)t2\n\nEquation 2: 1 -5t1 +7/3 = t2 => (10/3) -5t1 = t2.\n\nNow substitute equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n2 - 3t1 = (3/5)(10/3 -5t1)\n\nSimplify RHS: (3/5)(10/3) - (3/5)(5t1) = 2 - 3t1.\n\nSo equation 1 becomes: 2 - 3t1 = 2 - 3t1. Which is always true, meaning that the two lines are the same.\n\nSo, option (C)'s parameterization is just a different parameterization of the same line as (A). Similarly, what about option (E)? Let's check.\n\nOption (E): x = 0 +15t, y= -17/3 -25t.\n\nIf we compare to option (A): x=4 -3t, y=1 -5t.\n\nLet's see if they can represent the same line.\n\nSet 0 +15t1 =4 -3t2\n\nand -17/3 -25t1 =1 -5t2.\n\nSo:\n\n15t1 +3t2 =4\n\n25t1 +5t2 = 1 - (-17/3) = 1 +17/3=20/3\n\nNow, let's write the equations:\n\n15t1 +3t2 =4\n\n25t1 +5t2=20/3\n\nWe can simplify the first equation by dividing by 3: 5t1 + t2 =4/3\n\nSecond equation: 25t1 +5t2 =20/3, which is 5*(5t1 +t2)=20/3. Substitute 5t1 + t2 =4/3 from first equation: 5*(4/3)=20/3, which equals RHS. So equations are consistent, so t1 and t2 exist such that both equations are satisfied, so the lines are the same.\n\nTherefore, parameterizations (A), (C), and (E) are all parameterizations of the same line, just with different starting points and parameters scaled differently. So maybe these are considered valid as different parameterizations of the same line, so all three are correct.\n\nBut the question is about parameterizations, not necessarily different ones. So maybe all options are valid, but (E) just happens to be a different parameterization of the same line as (A). So is (E) also valid? Yes, I think so. It is a valid parameterization, just different from (A). \n\nBut wait, the question is just asking which of the options are valid parameterizations, without any specific line given. So in that case, all of them are valid as parameterizations of lines, regardless of whether they are the same line or not.\n\nBut maybe the problem is about parameterizing a particular line, and only some are correct?\n\nWait, I think perhaps I've got it wrong. Let me re-express the problem. Maybe it's about whether these parameterizations satisfy a certain equation, but the problem didn't specify any equation. So perhaps it's just a question about which parameterizations are correctly formed.\n\nGiven that, each is a point plus t times a direction vector, so each is a valid parameterization of a line. Therefore, all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit too straightforward, so maybe the problem is different. Maybe it's about whether the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other or something, or whether some direction vectors are zero or not.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is actually about normal vectors or tangent vectors? But no, in the context of parameterization of a line in 2D, it's just a point plus t times a direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider these as parameterizations in 3D, but no, they are in 2D.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check whether the direction vectors are correctly in the slope of the line.\n\nWait, without knowing the actual lines they are trying to parameterize, but in the options, are all parameterizations correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are testing whether the direction vectors are correct, like if they lie along a certain line, but since they aren't tied to any equation, it's difficult.\n\nWait, the problem statement is:\n\n\"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\n\n(A) [4,1] + t[-3,-5]\n\n(B) [17,5] + t[6,10]\n\n(C) [2, -7/3] + t[3/5,1]\n\n(D) [14/5, -1] + t[1, 3/5]\n\n(E) [0, -17/3] + t[15, -25]\"\n\nSo the question is, which of these are valid parameterizations. If the question is about just being a parameterization, i.e., representing a line in parametric form, then yes, all of them are, because each is a starting point plus a direction vector.\n\nBut wait, maybe they are parameterizing a specific line? Like, if these are meant to represent a particular line, then some may not lie on that line? But since the question doesn't state that, I think it's safest to assume that each is a valid parameterization of some line.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Maybe the problem is to check whether these parameterizations represent straight lines, but again, as they are given, they are straight lines. So each is a straight line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about whether these are correct for some equation? Without knowing the equation, maybe it's about parametrizing the same line, as in the lines for (A), (C), and (E) are the same, but others are different.\n\nWait, in that case, if the question is asking which are valid parameterizations, including different ones of the same line, then all are valid. So the answer is (A), (B), (C), (D), (E). But that can't be, as sometimes problems only expect certain ones to be valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps direction vectors are required to be simplified. For example, (A) has direction vector [-3, -5], which can't be simplified further as they are coprime. Option (B) is [6,10], which can be simplified to [3,5] by dividing by 2. Option (C) is [3/5,1], which is fine. Option (D) is [1, 3/5], which is also fine. Option (E) is [15, -25], which simplifies to [3, -5] as mentioned earlier.\n\nBut unless direction vectors need to be in some specific form, like integers, but option (A) and (B) have direction vectors with integers, (C) and (D) have fractions, but that's okay as parametric forms accept any real numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing the knowledge of equivalent parameterizations, as in (A), (C), and (E) are the same line but written differently.\n\nBut since all of them are valid, perhaps all are correct. But the initial thought was that maybe (E) is correct because it's written differently.\n\nWait, but again, if the question is just to identify valid parameterizations, regardless of whether they represent the same line or not, then all of them are correct. However, if the problem is from a source where only some are considered valid, then perhaps only certain ones.\n\nBut since the user hasn't given more context, like a specific line equation, which these are meant to represent, or any restrictions on the parameterizations, I think all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but wait again, looking back at the options, (E) has a direction vector [15, -25], which is equivalent to 5[3, -5], which is the same direction as option (A). So it's a different parameterization but the same line. So it's still a valid parameterization. So (E) is also valid.\n\nSimilarly, (A) is one parameterization, (C) is another with a different starting point and a scaled direction vector, which is still valid. So (A), (C), (E) are the same line but different parameterizations. (B) is a different line, and (D) is also a different line.\n\nSo the question is: are all of them valid parameterizations? If the question is about whether each is a valid parameterization, then yes. But maybe the original problem has a specific line in mind, but since it's not given here, I can't tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is from a test where the person is expected to pick all correct ones, which would be (A), (C), (E), or similar.\n\nWait, given the original options, (E) is a different parameterization of the same line as (A), but it's still correct. So if all are correct, then the answer is all letters: A, B, C, D, E. But given that, when I think again, parameterizations are different if they have different direction vectors or different starting points. So unless the question restricts to a specific line, like only parameterizing the same line as (A), but since it's not specified, I think all are valid.\n\nBut this contradicts the user instruction, which says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" And the original problem says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So that indicates that each option is a parameterization, and we need to say which ones are correct. So since each is a parameterization of a line, so all are correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me check option (B): direction vector [6,10], and starting point (17,5). Is there any reason to think that might not be valid? For example, is the direction vector allowed? Since [6,10] is a valid direction vector, as it's non-zero. So (B) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (D): starting point (14/5, -1), which is (2.8, -1), and direction vector [1, 3/5], which is (1, 0.6). That's fine, as direction vectors can have fractional components.\n\nOption (C): starting point (2, -7/3), which is roughly (2, -2.333), and direction vector (0.6, 1), which is fine.\n\nOption (A): starting at (4,1), direction vector (-3,-5), that's good.\n\nOption (E): starting at (0, -17/3), direction vector (15, -25), which is a multiple of (-3, -5). So all direction vectors are okay.\n\nSo perhaps all options are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, but I recall that sometimes, parameterizations might need the direction vector to be a unit vector or something, but in general, direction vectors can be any non-zero vector. So unless specified, any non-zero direction vector is acceptable. Since all options have non-zero direction vectors, they're all valid parameterizations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is all of them: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\nBut wait, this is getting confusing because the original problem is ambiguous. If it's parameterizing a specific line, then only those with the same line would be valid, but as we saw, (A), (C), and (E) are the same line.\n\nBut the question says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" without specifying. So as parameterizations in general, all are valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is all of them: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut looking back, the way the question is phrased: \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So each option is a candidate to be a parameterization, so if each one is a correct parameterization of some line, then the answer is all. So, yeah, A, B, C, D, E.\n\nWait, but on second thought, sometimes, when the starting point is incorrect or the direction vector doesn't satisfy something, but in this case, each one is a valid point and a valid direction vector, so each is a valid parameterization.\n\nSo yeah, all of them are valid. Hence, the correct options are A, B, C, D, E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations are valid, we need to check if each option is a correct parameterization of a line. A parameterization is generally given by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. Each option is a valid parameterization of a line because they all have a starting point and a direction vector.\n\n1. **Option (A)**: The parameterization is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is a valid parameterization because it has a starting point and a direction vector.\n2. **Option (B)**: The parameterization is \\(\\begin",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here with five options, labeled A to E, each of which is a parameterization of a line in the plane. My task is to figure out which of these are valid parameterizations. Hmm, I remember that a valid parameterization of a line should satisfy certain conditions. Let me try to recall what those are.\n\nFirst off, a parameterization of a line in 2D is generally written as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{p} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector. The parameter \\(t\\) can be any real number. So, for each option, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Does the point \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) lie on the line in question? Wait, hold on, actually, each of these seems to represent a line, so maybe they're all already parameterized lines? Or maybe I need to check if each parameterization correctly describes the intended line, though I don't see specific lines given here. Hmm, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, no, the problem just says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" without specifying particular lines. Maybe I need to determine if each given parameterization correctly represents a line in 2D space. Since each option is given as a vector function with a parameter \\(t\\), I think they are all lines, each starting at point \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and extending infinitely in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nTherefore, the key thing to check here is whether each of these is indeed a valid parametric equation for a line. So, what makes a parameterization valid? Well, in a valid parameterization, the direction vector shouldn't be the zero vector, because that would mean it's not a line but just a single point. Additionally, the point \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) is just a starting point, so any non-zero direction vector would suffice.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Maybe in the context of this problem, the original question might have specific lines they correspond to, and we need to verify if the given parameterizations correctly represent those lines. But since the problem doesn't specify lines, perhaps it's just about each being a valid parametric line without restrictions. \n\nHowever, looking again, maybe I was wrong earlier. The problem says, \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" So, if we consider that all options are supposed to represent the same line, then we might need to check consistency. But in the given problem statement, it just presents five different parameterizations, each for presumably different lines, so the question is whether each one is a valid parameterization on its own.\n\nBut wait, actually, the problem may not be clear on this. Since it doesn't specify particular lines, it's possible that all the given parameterizations are valid. But that can't be the case, because direction vectors can sometimes be simplified or scaled. Maybe they need to be checked for being consistent in the direction, or something else.\n\nWait, let me think. The problem just asks which options are valid parameterizations. Since any non-zero vector can be a direction vector, and any point can be on the line, I don't see why they wouldn't be valid unless, for example, the direction vector is a zero vector or the equations don't satisfy the line. But in each case, the direction vectors are non-zero.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is clearly non-zero. So, that's valid.\n\nOption B: Direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\), also non-zero. Valid.\n\nOption C: Direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), non-zero. Valid.\n\nOption D: Direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), non-zero. Valid.\n\nOption E: Direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\), non-zero. Valid.\n\nWait, so all of them have non-zero direction vectors, so they are all valid parametrizations? That seems too straightforward. Is there more to this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to check if the given parametric equations correctly represent lines, but without specific lines defined, any parametric equation is valid as long as the direction vector is not zero.\n\nWait, is there something else I need to consider? Let's think about each option in more detail.\n\nFor each option, we can write the parametric equations as:\n\nFor (A):\n\\(x = 4 - 3t\\)\n\\(y = 1 - 5t\\)\n\nFor (B):\n\\(x = 17 + 6t\\)\n\\(y = 5 + 10t\\)\n\nFor (C):\n\\(x = 2 + (3/5)t\\)\n\\(y = -7/3 + t\\)\n\nFor (D):\n\\(x = 14/5 + t\\)\n\\(y = -1 + (3/5)t\\)\n\nFor (E):\n\\(x = 0 + 15t\\)\n\\(y = -17/3 -25t\\)\n\nEach of these is a linear function of \\(t\\), so each represents a line. Since parametrization in 2D just needs a point and a direction vector, and all these have non-zero direction vectors, they're all valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about scaling the direction vector? For example, sometimes parametrizations are considered equivalent if they differ by a scalar multiple in the direction vector. So, if two parametrizations have direction vectors that are scalar multiples, they represent the same line. But the question is about validity, not equivalence.\n\nWait, unless the question is in reference to a specific line, but since it's not given, perhaps it's just about whether they are valid parametric equations for a line, which they all are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial point is incorrect? For example, plugging \\(t = 0\\), the point \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) should lie on some line. But without a specific line, it's hard to tell. Maybe each of these is a separate line, and the question is about their validity.\n\nBut since all options have non-zero direction vectors, I think they are all valid. But wait, let me check if any of them have direction vectors with fractions or something that might not be correct. For example, in option C, the direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is fine; it's a valid direction.\n\nOption D: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), also valid.\n\nOption E: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\). That's the same direction as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) scaled by 5, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if the direction vector is normalized or something, but I don't think that matters for validity.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose that the question is expecting us to check for something else, like whether the parametrization is differentiable or something—no, that's beyond the scope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that each parameterization is supposed to represent a specific line, but since they are all separate, maybe each is valid.\n\nHmm, unless the question is in a context where they are all parameterizations for the same line, but without additional info, I think it's just about each one being a valid line.\n\nBut maybe the question is about the direction vector or something else. Wait, another thought: maybe it's about the direction vector being a unit vector? But no, in parametrization, direction vectors can be any non-zero vector, not necessarily unit vectors. So scaling doesn't affect validity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to check that the given parametrization correctly expresses the line, but since no specific line is given, I can't verify that.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\n\n(A) [equation]\"\n\nHmm, so each option is a different parameterization. The problem is to figure out which of the given parameterizations are valid. If all are valid, because their direction vectors are non-zero, then perhaps the answer is all of them.\n\nBut I think the direction vector is just a matter of scaling, so as long as it's non-zero, the parametrization is valid.\n\nWait, unless the point is incorrect? For example, is the initial point supposed to lie on the line or something? Wait, unless each option is for a specific line, but we don't have the lines defined.\n\nWait, I think I need to make sure that I interpret the problem correctly. Maybe each option is a parameterization of a specific line, but without knowing the lines, the problem is to determine if the given parametrizations are correct.\n\nBut unless each option is a line with certain properties, which are not given, I can't compare.\n\nWait, maybe there's an error here. The problem doesn't specify the lines that the parameterizations should represent, so we can't validate them against specific lines. Thus, all of them are valid parameterizations, as long as their direction vectors are non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, if each option was supposed to represent the same line, then we could check if the direction vectors are scalar multiples and the points lie on the same line, but without more info, that's impossible.\n\nWait, let's see what the parameterizations are.\n\nOption A: Starting at (4,1) with direction (-3,-5). Let's see the slope is dy/dx = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3.\n\nOption B: Starting at (17,5) with direction (6,10). Slope is 10/6 = 5/3.\n\nOption C: Starting at (2, -7/3) with direction (3/5,1). Slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3.\n\nOption D: Starting at (14/5, -1) with direction (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, that's a slope of 3/5, which is different from the others.\n\nOption E: Starting at (0, -17/3) with direction (15, -25). Slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nWait a minute, so except for option D, which has a slope of 3/5, all the others have slope 5/3. So if the problem is that each parameterization is supposed to represent a line with slope 5/3, then option D is invalid. Alternatively, if all should have the same slope, then E is invalid. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'm confused.\n\nWait, hold on, the problem just says \"valid parameterizations\", without specific reference to any particular lines. So maybe all of them are valid regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the parameterizations have direction vectors that are scalar multiples, so in that sense, they might represent the same line but with different parameters, so they're valid but equivalent. But that still doesn't affect validity, just equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting points are incorrect for certain lines, but again, without specific lines, I can't say.\n\nWait, unless we consider that in parametrization, if the direction vector is not consistent with the line's slope, then the parametrization is invalid.\n\nBut without knowing the lines, I can't check the slopes.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about the parametrization being linear, all are linear in t, so all are valid.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to interpret the question in another way. If all five options are given as different parameterizations, and the question is which are valid. Without more information, perhaps all are valid because they are correctly formed.\n\nWait, let me check: to have a valid parameterization, you need a point and a direction vector. So as long as they are non-zero, it's fine. So all are correct.\n\nBut wait, when t varies, does each parametrization correctly trace a line? Yes, because for each t, you get a point on the line.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut looking at option D, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). So the slope would be 3/5, but if other options have a different slope, unless the question is about all parameterizations having the same slope, then D is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe that's what's intended. Maybe the question is testing if the parameterizations are consistent in representing lines of the same slope, so to find which are valid in representing lines with a certain slope.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about whether the parametrization is given in terms of line equations.\n\nWait, each option is given as:\n\nx = something, y = something in t.\n\nSo, to see if each is valid, we can compute the slope and see if it's consistent.\n\nWait, in that case, let me compute the slope for each option.\n\nSlope is (dy/dt)/(dx/dt).\n\nFor option A:\ndx/dt = -3, dy/dt = -5. Slope = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3.\n\nOption B:\ndx/dt = 6, dy/dt = 10. Slope = 10/6 = 5/3.\n\nOption C:\ndx/dt = 3/5, dy/dt = 1. Slope = 1 / (3/5) = 5/3.\n\nOption D:\ndx/dt = 1, dy/dt = 3/5. Slope = (3/5)/1 = 3/5.\n\nOption E:\ndx/dt = 15, dy/dt = -25. Slope = (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nSo, option D has a different slope, 3/5, whereas the rest have 5/3. Option E has slope -5/3, which is the negative of the others. So if the question is about parameterizing lines with a certain slope, say 5/3, then options A, B, and C are valid, and D and E are invalid. But since the question is just asking for valid parameterizations, regardless of the slope, then all are valid. But in that case, the slopes don't affect validity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of them have inconsistent direction vectors or something. Let me check if any have direction vectors that are zero vectors, but none of them do. For example, all the direction vectors have at least one non-zero component.\n\nTherefore, I think all of them are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, looking again at option D: direction vector is (1, 3/5). That's equivalent to (5, 3) when scaled by 5. So if we consider that a direction vector can be scaled, and the parametrization is still valid.\n\nSimilarly, option E: direction vector is (15, -25), which is equivalent to (3, -5) scaled by 5. So as long as the direction is correct, that's fine.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects us to see whether these parameterizations can be simplified or scaled, but I think that doesn't matter for validity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the initial points is not on a certain line, but since we don't have a specific line, I can't say.\n\nWait, another thought: In 2D, a line can be expressed as y = mx + b or parametrically as x = x0 + at, y = y0 + bt.\n\nSo, for each parametrization, as long as we can express it in either form, it's a valid parameterization.\n\nSo, for each option, I can try to convert it to the slope-intercept form and see if it's a line.\n\nStarting with option A:\n\nx = 4 - 3t\ny = 1 -5t\n\nExpress t from x: t = (4 - x)/3. Plug into y: y = 1 -5*(4 - x)/3 = 1 - (20 - 5x)/3 = (3 -20 +5x)/3 = (5x -17)/3\n\nWhich is y = (5/3)x -17/3. That's a valid line.\n\nOption B:\n\nx =17 +6t\ny =5 +10t\n\nSolve for t: t = (x -17)/6\n\nPlug into y: y =5 +10*(x -17)/6 = 5 + (10x -170)/6 = (30 +10x -170)/6 = (10x -140)/6 = (5x -70)/3\n\nWhich is y = (5/3)x -70/3. Also a valid line.\n\nOption C:\n\nx =2 + (3/5)t\ny =-7/3 + t\n\nSolve for t: from x: t = (x -2)*(5/3)\n\nPlug into y: y = -7/3 + (5/3)(x -2) = -7/3 + (5x/3 -10/3) = (5x -17)/3\n\nSo y = (5/3)x -17/3. Another line with the same slope.\n\nOption D:\n\nx =14/5 + t\ny = -1 + (3/5)t\n\nSolve for t from x: t = x -14/5\n\nPlug into y: y = -1 + (3/5)(x -14/5) = -1 + (3x/5 -42/25) = ( -25/25 -42/25 ) + 3x/5 = (-67/25) + 3x/5\n\nWhich is y = (3/5)x -67/25. So it's a different slope, 3/5, which is different, but still a valid line.\n\nOption E:\n\nx =0 +15t\ny =-17/3 -25t\n\nSolve for t: t = x/15\n\nPlug into y: y = -17/3 -25*(x/15) = -17/3 - (5x)/3 = (-5x -17)/3\n\nWhich is y = (-5/3)x -17/3. A valid line, but with a different slope.\n\nSo, each of these parameterizations is for a different line,",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations. The options are labeled (A) through (E), each presenting a vector equation in parametric form. Hmm, let me recall what defines a valid parameterization.\n\nA parameterization of a line in the plane is generally given by a point and a direction vector. The standard form is usually something like:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line, and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector. So, for each option, I should check two things: first, that there's a specific point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) given when \\(t = 0\\), and second, that the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent for all \\(t\\). \n\nI think all these options are given in such a form, so they are equations of lines in parametric form. However, maybe some have restrictions or might not cover the entire line correctly? Let me think. Since the parameter \\(t\\) can be any real number, unless there are restrictions, all of these should be valid parameterizations of some line.\n\nWait, but maybe the point has to lie on a specific line? No, the question doesn't specify any particular line; it's just asking if the given equation is a valid parameterization. Since each one has a specific point and a direction vector, each one is a valid parameterization of a unique line. So, are all options valid? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look again at the options.\n\nOption (A) starts at (4,1) and has a direction vector of (-3,-5). That seems fine. A line is defined by a point and a direction vector, so unless the direction vector is zero, it's fine. Similarly, for each option, the direction vector is a non-zero vector, so each should represent a valid line.\n\nBut hold on, is there a case where the direction vector might not span the line properly? For instance, if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of another direction vector, then they're not unique, but that doesn't make the parameterization invalid. It just means the parameterizations are different but describe the same line.\n\nSo, unless the direction vector is zero, which is not the case here, each of these should be valid.\n\nTherefore, if all options are in the correct form and the direction vectors are non-zero, then all of them are valid.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each one.\n\nOption (A): The direction vector is (-3,-5). So, slope is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. That's fine.\n\nOption (B): Direction vector is (6,10), slope is 10/6 = 5/3. So same slope as (A). That's fine too.\n\nOption (C): Direction vector is (3/5,1). Slope is 1/(3/5) = 5/3. Again, same slope. Hmm.\n\nOption (D): Direction vector is (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, wait, is that right? Wait, hold on. Slope is Δy/Δx, so that would be 3/5 divided by 1, so slope is 3/5. Wait, no, no. Wait, the direction vector is (1, 3/5), so from x to y, it's moving 1 in x and 3/5 in y. So slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. So, different from the others.\n\nBut direction vector of (3/5,1) is slope 5/3, and (1,3/5) is slope 3/5. Wait, but is that acceptable? Yes, because the direction vectors have different slopes.\n\nWait, but if all these parameterizations are representing different lines, each with their own slopes, then they are all valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, let me think if the question is maybe about something else. The problem says, \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" It doesn't specify a particular line. So, if we're only considering the form, then all are valid.\n\nBut, hang on, I might be missing something. Let me check if any of these parameterizations might have constraints or if the direction vectors are not correctly scaled or something.\n\nNo, because in parametric equations, the direction vector can be any non-zero vector, scaled as necessary. So unless it's the zero vector, which is not the case here, they are all valid.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes, a parameterization is considered valid if it can be expressed without some restriction, like perhaps avoiding division by zero or something. Hmm. For example, looking at the starting points or the direction vectors.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption (C): Starts at (2, -7/3) and direction vector is (3/5, 1). So, is there any issue with this?\n\nWait, if we plug in t = 0, we get (2, -7/3). So, unless that point is not on the intended line, it's fine. But since the question doesn't specify any line, just the form is sufficient.\n\nSimilarly, for option (D), it starts at (14/5, -1). Hmm, that seems okay too.\n\nOption (E): Starts at (0, -17/3) and direction vector is (15, -25). That seems fine as well.\n\nWait, is there something about the direction vectors or points that might make some invalid?\n\nWait, maybe if the direction vector can be simplified such that one is a multiple of another? Let's see.\n\nOption (A): direction vector (-3,-5). Option (B): (6,10). Wait, 6 and 10 are multiples of -3 and -5 with scalar -2, but direction vector is multiplied by -2. So, same direction.\n\nSimilarly, Option (C): (3/5, 1). If we multiply by 5, we get (3,5), which is same direction as (A) and (B). So, same line but scaled.\n\nOption (D): (1, 3/5). If we scale it by 5, we get (5, 3). Which is different from (A), (B), and (C). Wait, wait, no: (3/5,1) scaled by 5 is (3,5). So, (A), (B), (C) have direction vectors ( -3, -5 ), (6,10 ), (3/5, 1 ) which are scalar multiples (with some scaling factors) of (3,5 ). So all of these are the same line but parameterized differently.\n\nWait, but no, Option (D) is different. Let's see, direction vector is (1, 3/5 ). So, that's (1, 0.6). Whereas (3,5 ) is (3,5 ). So, different direction.\n\nWait, the direction vector for (D) is (1, 3/5 ). If you reverse it, it's (-1, -3/5 ). Is that similar to any other direction vector? It's not. So, that is a different line, same as others.\n\nSo, options (A), (B), (C) have direction vectors that are scalar multiples, meaning they're all different parameterizations of the same line. While options (D) and (E) have direction vectors that are different from (A), (B), and (C).\n\nWait, but all these are valid. Each is a different parameterization of their own lines.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about the correctness of the parameterization as a function of t. Since each one has a direction vector and a starting point, they are all valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, the problem says, \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" It doesn't specify a particular line or anything. So, is each of these options a valid parameterization? Or does the problem assume a specific line?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misworded? Maybe it says \"parameterizations of a particular line\"? Then, if all these are parameterizations of different lines, they can't all be correct.\n\nWait, but re-reading the problem: \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\"\n\nSo, maybe in this context, a parameterization is of a line, regardless of the line. Then, if all are valid parameterizations of lines, as long as they have the correct form.\n\nSo, to re-verify: a parameterization is valid if it has the form \\(\\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{b}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a direction vector. Since all options are given in that form, with a direction vector and a point, then all are valid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have all these parameterizations be for a specific line, perhaps the same line? Or maybe they all need to represent the same line.\n\nWait, that's another interpretation. Maybe the problem is asking which of these are valid parameterizations for a particular line, say the line containing the point with direction vector given.\n\nBut the way it's written is just \"valid parameterizations\" without specifying, so perhaps each is a valid parameterization of some line. Therefore, all options are correct. So, the answer would be all of them: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\nBut wait, that seems too confident. Let me verify each one step by step.\n\nOption (A): \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nThis seems correct. When \\(t=0\\), it gives (4,1). The direction vector is (-3, -5), which is non-zero. So, it's a valid parameterization of the line passing through (4,1) with direction (-3,-5).\n\nOption (B): \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nSimilarly, this is a valid parameterization. Point (17,5) and direction vector (6,10). It's a different line compared to (A), since the direction vector is a multiple of (-3,-5), but starting from a different point.\n\nWait, no, 6 is -2*(-3), and 10 is -2*(-5). So, direction is the same as (A), but from a different point, so they are different lines. But both are valid parameterizations. So, yes.\n\nOption (C): \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nYes, point (2, -7/3) and direction (3/5,1). Is this a valid parameterization? Yes, it's a non-zero direction vector, so it's fine.\n\nOption (D): \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nYes, same reasoning: non-zero direction vector and a starting point. So, this is valid.\n\nOption (E): \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nYes, direction vector (15, -25). Let me check if this can be simplified. 15 divided by 5 is 3, -25 divided by 5 is -5. So, direction vector is (3, -5). So, is this the same as any of the previous ones?\n\nIn option (A), direction vector is (-3,-5). So, similar but not same. Option (B) had direction (6,10) which is 2*(3,5). Option (C) is (3/5,1) which when scaled by 5 is (3,5). So, (15,-25) is (3,-5) scaled by 5, so it's in the same direction as option (A) but different starting point.\n\nSo, direction vectors for (A) and (E) are scalar multiples, but they're both non-zero, so both are valid.\n\nWait, but actually, in parametric equations, as long as the direction vector is non-zero, it's a valid parameterization. So, each of these is valid.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations, each representing different lines.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let me consider if the direction vector has to be a unit vector or something? No, because direction vectors can be any non-zero vector.\n\nAlso, the point can be any point on the line. So, each one is just choosing a different starting point and a different scaling for the direction vector.\n\nTherefore, I don't see a reason to eliminate any of the options. Each one follows the correct form and has a non-zero direction vector.\n\nHence, all options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut, hold on, another point: in parametric equations, sometimes we can write them with different t coefficients or shifts, but I think that's already taken into account by scaling t or shifting the point. So, all these are just different ways to represent lines.\n\nSo, since all options have a point and a direction vector, they're all valid. Therefore, I think all of them are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" But in my thought process, I concluded all of them are correct. However, I have a doubt because the parameterizations might have some scaling issues or direction issues.\n\nWait, for instance, looking back at the slope calculations for each option:\n\nOption (A): Slope is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3.\n\nOption (B): Slope is 10/6 = 5/3. Same slope as (A).\n\nOption (C): Slope is 1/(3/5) = 5/3.\n\nOption (D): Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5.\n\nOption (E): Slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nWait, so the slopes are different for each option. So, each parameterization is for a different line with different slopes.\n\nSo, if the question is which of the following are valid parameterizations, then even though each is a different line, they are all still valid.\n\nHence, yes, all of them are correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is all of them, as each one is a valid parameterization in the form required. So, (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about if any of these might not represent a line correctly.\n\nNo, because each one is of the form point plus t times direction vector, which is the standard parameterization of a line. So, even if they have different starting points and different direction vectors, they all are lines in the plane.\n\nThus, yeah, all options are valid parameterizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations, we need to check if each option is in the form of a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. The standard form of a parameterization is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector. \n\n1. **Option (A)**: The direction vector is \\((-3, -5)\\). This is a non-zero vector, so it is valid.\n2. **Option (B)**: The direction vector is \\((6, 10)\\). This is a non-zero vector, so it is valid.\n3. **Option (C)**: The direction vector is \\((3/5, 1)\\). This is a non-zero vector, so it is valid.\n4. **Option (D)**: The direction vector is \\((1, 3/5)\\). This is a non-zero vector, so it is valid.\n5. **Option (E)**: The direction vector is \\((15, -25)\\). This is a non-zero vector, so it is valid.\n\nEach option has a starting point and a non-zero direction vector, making them all valid parameterizations of different lines. \n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{B}, \\boxed{C}, \\boxed{D}, \\boxed{E}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with five options, each representing a parameterization of a line in two dimensions. I need to figure out which ones are valid parameterizations. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a parameterization of a line in two dimensions looks like.\n\nA parameterization of a line generally has the form:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a point on the line, and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the direction vector of the line, and \\(t\\) is a parameter that can take any real number value.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to check two things:\n1. Does the given vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) lie on the line defined by that equation?\n2. Is the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) consistent with being along the line?\n\nWait, actually, no. Maybe I misphrased that. Since it's a parameterization, it just needs to represent any point on the line for some value of \\(t\\). So the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) can be any non-zero vector parallel to the line. Similarly, the point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a specific point on the line when \\(t = 0\\). So, to check validity, I don't necessarily need to check if the point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) lies on the line because it's part of the parameterization. Wait, but hold on. Is that correct?\n\nActually, maybe I'm confusing it. Let me think again. If I have a line in two dimensions, any parameterization must be a point plus a direction vector multiplied by a scalar. So the parameterization must satisfy the equation of the line for all values of \\(t\\). Therefore, the direction vector must lie along the line, and the point when \\(t=0\\) must lie on the line.\n\nBut in the given options, are we given specific lines? Wait, hold on, the problem says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" But in the original problem statement, it doesn't specify any particular line for these parameterizations to belong to. Hmm, that seems off. Wait, let me look back at the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is actually presented as a parameterization of a line without any reference line specified. So, is this a parameterization of a particular line, or is this in reference to another line? Wait, perhaps the original problem might have had specific lines defined, but in this prompt, it just shows the options with these vector equations.\n\nWait, now that I think about it, in the problem statement, it just says \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" without mentioning any specific lines. Hmm, that seems incomplete because a parameterization is relative to a specific line. So perhaps the question is misstated? Or maybe it's referring to the parameterization in general, irrespective of specific lines? That seems odd.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if it's just asking whether the given vector equations are valid parameterizations, without any context, then perhaps each vector equation is a valid representation of some line, and so each is a valid parameterization. But that seems too trivial because every option would be a valid parameterization for some line.\n\nWait, that can't be. The question is likely about the parameterizations for the same line or following certain conditions. Maybe in the original problem, which isn't fully provided here, there was a specific line given, and the question is whether these parameterizations represent the same line or equivalent representations.\n\nSince I don't have the exact problem, perhaps I need to make an assumption. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a standard source, and the options refer to parameterizations of a line given in another form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is as presented, and we need to assess each vector equation without any reference. Hmm. Without knowing the original line's equation or direction, it's hard to assess the validity. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that all lines pass through the origin? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question in the textbook has specific lines or all lines are arbitrary. But since it's not given here, maybe it's supposed to be an independent question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about whether each of these is a valid parametric equation in general, regardless of what line it's representing. But in that case, yes, all of these are valid parametric equations, just with different points and direction vectors.\n\nBut maybe the question is in reference to a particular line in the problem set, so without that information, I can't evaluate. Hmm, I think this is a problem. Because if the question is about whether each is a valid parameterization without any context, then all are valid, which is trivial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each option is given as a parameterization, but it's in the context of representing a specific line, maybe the same line or different ones. But without that context, how can I check for validity?\n\nWait, maybe if I assume that all these parameterizations are parameterizations of the same line, then we can check if they are consistent. But again, the problem just says \"valid parameterizations\", not specifying what line.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me go back.\n\nThe problem says: \"Which of the following options are valid parameterizations?\" Each option is a vector equation. Since a valid parameterization just needs to have a point and a direction vector, I think each of these is a valid parameterization. Therefore, all options A through E are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, because often in such multiple-choice questions, they refer to being a valid parameterization for a specific line, which requires more checks.\n\nWait, since I can't be sure, maybe I should recall that a parameterization of a line requires the direction vector to be scalar multiples of each other if they represent the same line. But again, without knowing if they're meant to represent the same line or any line, I can't say.\n\nWait, in the problem, as given in the prompt, it's just each option as a parameterization. So if we're only checking if each equation is a parameterization, regardless of line, then each is valid because they follow the structure of a vector equation for a line in 2D.\n\nBut that might not make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps the problem is in reference to a particular line, say, one that's given in another part, and the options are parameterizations for that line. Since the original problem isn't fully provided, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the question is asking for which of these are valid parameterizations for some line, which they all are, as each is in the form of a point plus a direction vector times a scalar.\n\nBut that would mean all are correct, which would be options A, B, C, D, E.\n\nBut in that case, the user is supposed to specify which are correct, perhaps all of them. But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about whether the given equations are parametric equations for lines, without any specific reference to another line. But that is trivially true.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe in the original problem, each of these was given as a parameterization for a specific line, and the question is to figure out which ones are valid, in the sense that for each given point, does the direction vector make sense.\n\nWait, since I don't have that, perhaps I should check whether each of these is a valid parametrization of a line without any specific line in mind, which they are all. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is presented in a context where it refers to parameterizing a particular line, say, a specific one that isn't stated here, but perhaps in the problem set before. Without that information, I can't really evaluate each one's validity.\n\nBut given that I have to answer, perhaps I should consider whether each parameterization has the direction vector correctly pointing along the line, but since we don't have the line, maybe I can't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction vector can be scaled down, or something.\n\nWait, no, that's overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is actually asking about whether each of these is a valid parameterization of a particular standard line, say, for example, the x-axis or y-axis, but without that information, again, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was in a context where before, the line was given, and now these are parameterizations to represent it.\n\nBut without that context, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let's think about this differently. Each of these is a parametric equation of a line in 2D. Therefore, all of them are valid parameterizations of some line. Therefore, all options are valid.\n\nBut that would make the answer A, B, C, D, E. But in the instructions, the user said \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So perhaps I need to confirm.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is asking which of these is a parameterization of a specific line, say, perhaps the line through a given point with a given direction, but without knowing the line, it's impossible.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps each of these parameterizations can represent different lines, so they're all valid.\n\nWait, but if the question is about a different criterion, like having the direction vector lying on a particular direction or something else, but without specific information, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe this is an image or part of a larger problem that isn't included here. Without that, perhaps I have to give an answer assuming that each option is presented as a general parameterization, which is valid.\n\nBut in that case, all would be valid, which is too trivial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is about the direction vector being non-zero.\n\nBut all direction vectors here are non-zero.\n\nWait, looking at each one:\n\n(A) direction vector (-3, -5): non-zero.\n\n(B) direction vector (6,10): non-zero.\n\n(C) (3/5, 1): non-zero.\n\n(D) (1, 3/5): non-zero.\n\n(E) (15, -25): non-zero.\n\nSo all direction vectors are non-zero. Therefore, each is a valid parameterization of some line, regardless of the point chosen.\n\nTherefore, all options are valid.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, so I have a feeling that I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to standard parameterizations, like if they are in the form starting from the origin or something, but again, no.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps they need to pass through a specific point, which isn't given here, making it impossible to evaluate.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem was about the same line but given in different forms, but the user has omitted that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think of whether each direction vector is a scalar multiple of each other, to see if they represent the same line or different lines.\n\nWait, that might be a stretch.\n\nSo, for example, the direction vector in A is (-3, -5). In B, it's (6, 10), which is -2 times (-3, -5), so same direction, different starting point.\n\nIn C, the direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's see if that is a scalar multiple of any of the others.\n\nDividing the components: (3/5)/1 = 3/5, and 1/1 = 1, so it's a different direction.\n\nSimilarly, D's direction vector is (1, 3/5). Let's check if it's a scalar multiple of A's direction vector.\n\nCheck if 1 / (-3) = (3/5) / (-5). 1/-3 = -1/3, (3/5)/(-5)= -3/25. Not equal. So D's direction is different from A's.\n\nE's direction vector is (15, -25). Let's see if it's a multiple of any. 15/-25 simplifies to -3/5. So, is E's direction vector a multiple of A's or B's?\n\nA's is (-3, -5); 15/-25 is -3/5. So, -3/5 = (-3)/-5. So if you multiply A's direction by (-3/5), you get (9/5, 3). Wait, 15/-25 simplifies to -3/5. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, let's see: A is (-3, -5); multiplying by (-5) gives (15,25), which is not E's direction. Wait, E's direction is (15, -25). Let's see, 15 divided by (-3) is -5; -25 divided by (-5) is 5. So, if I factor out -5, A's direction becomes (3,5). Hmm, which is not equal to E's direction.\n\nWait, 15/3=5, -25/5=-5. Hmm, so it's not a scalar multiple. So E's direction vector isn't a scalar multiple of A's.\n\nTherefore, each option has a unique direction vector, different from others.\n\nSo, if each parameterization represents a different line, each one is valid.\n\nBut then why is the question asking which are valid? Because unless they are talking about the same line, the directions vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is about the standard parameterization of a line, meaning for each line, a specific parameterization is given, but we have to see which are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps they refer to normalized vectors or something, but without specific lines, it's impossible to tell.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps each of these parameterizations is a parameterization of a line, but we need to see if the direction vector is consistent with the line's slope.\n\nWait, but without knowing the line's equation, it's still unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is for a specific line, say, x-axis or y-axis, or another. But without that, I can't.\n\nWait, perhaps, stepping back, the problem is actually to check whether each parameterization is a valid way to parameterize a line, meaning whether they satisfy the line equation.\n\nBut without knowing the equation, how can we verify? That seems impossible.\n\nWait, unless, perhaps, it's in reference to a specific line that is the same as the parameterization of a line through the origin with direction vector given. But that seems not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's referring to parametrization in terms of standard basis vectors or something, but no.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach: check if each vector equation satisfies the condition for being a parameterization of a line.\n\nBut that's always true unless the direction vector is zero, which they're not.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction vector is not constant, but in each case, it's a constant vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about whether each has the same direction as the standard parameterization. But without direction defined, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe all options are valid, so all letters A, B, C, D, E are correct. But is that the case?\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps the direction vector is given as starting from the point. Wait, for example, in option A, it starts at (4,1), and direction vector is (-3,-5). So any point on that line can be reached by adding t*(-3,-5). Similarly for others.\n\nTherefore, yes, each is a valid parameterization because they follow the form point + t*(direction vector). Therefore, all of them are valid.\n\nBut that seems too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to whether the direction vector is normalized or something, but that's more of a numerical analysis.\n\nWait, looking at the direction vectors:\n\n(A) (-3, -5): magnitude sqrt(9 + 25) = sqrt(34) ≈5.83\n\n(B) (6,10): magnitude sqrt(36 + 100) = sqrt(136)≈11.66\n\n(C) (3/5, 1): magnitude sqrt(9/25 + 1)=sqrt(34/25)=sqrt(34)/5≈1.16\n\n(D) (1, 3/5): magnitude sqrt(1 + 9/25)=sqrt(34/25)=sqrt(34)/5≈1.16\n\n(E) (15, -25): magnitude sqrt(225 + 625)=sqrt(850)≈29.15\n\nSo, each direction vector has a different magnitude, but as parameterizations, direction vectors can be any non-zero vectors. So, if it's just about direction, they are all valid.\n\nTherefore, perhaps all are correct.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward for a problem asking which are valid, so maybe I have an error in reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps they refer to whether the point given is on the line defined by the parameterization, but without knowing the line, how can we know? So perhaps that's not.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps each parameterization is of a line, and the question is whether each parameterization is correct in that it passes through the given point with the given direction.\n\nBut again, without knowing a reference line, I can't verify.\n\nWait, perhaps, given that it's a math problem, it's expecting something specific, perhaps each has to be simplified or written in some standard form. For example, if a parameterization has to be written in the form y = mx + b, but without specific lines, that might not be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are referring to parametric equations where x and y are expressed as functions of a parameter t, which is trivial as they already are. So, again, no, all of them are valid.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe in terms of direction vectors, some are scalar multiples of each other, which would mean they are the same line, but since the points are different, they are different lines. Therefore, each parameterization is of a different line, but they're all valid because they're correct parameterizations.\n\nWait, but in that case, unless the question is about something else, like whether the direction vectors are correct in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of these is supposed to represent the same line, which would need consistent direction vectors, but I don't think so because their direction vectors are different.\n\nWait, for example, direction vectors in A and B are scalar multiples (B is -2*A), so they have the same direction, so they represent the same line but different parameterizations. Similarly, direction vectors in C and D have the same magnitude but different directions. E is similar to A but scaled by -5.\n\nWait, E: direction vector (15, -25) is the same direction as (-3, -5) but scaled by -5.\n\nTherefore, if the line is defined by direction vector (-3, -5), then both A and E are parameterizations for the same line, just with different points and scaling.\n\nSimilarly, B is a",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations (A to E) correctly represent the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The question is multiple choice, so I have to check each option and see if it accurately parameterizes the given line.\n\nFirst, I recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form is usually written as r = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a specific point on the line (the initial point), and v is the direction vector of the line. So for each option, I need to verify two things: \n\n1. Does the initial point lie on the given line?\n2. Is the direction vector parallel to the given line?\n\nLet me handle the second part first because that's probably easier. The given line is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The direction vector for a line y = mx + b should have a slope of m. In vector form, the direction vector would typically have a direction vector (1, m) because for every increase of 1 in x, y increases by m. \n\nWait, hold on, actually, the direction vector can be any scalar multiple of (1, m). So if the parameterization has a direction vector, it should be a scalar multiple of (3, 5) because 5/3 is the slope. Let's confirm: if I have a direction vector (a, b), then the slope should be b/a. So if the slope needs to be 5/3, then b/a = 5/3, so (a, b) could be (3, 5) or any multiple, like (6, 10), (-9, -15), etc.\n\nSo I need to check for each option if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of (3, 5). Let me list the direction vectors for each option:\n\nA: (-3, -5)\nB: (6, 10)\nC: (3/5, 1)\nD: (1, 3/5)\nE: (15, -25)\n\nNow, let's see if each direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3,5). \n\nStarting with option A: direction vector is (-3, -5). Comparing to (3,5), multiplying both components by -1 gives (3,5). So yes, (-3, -5) is a scalar multiple (-1) of (3,5). So the direction is correct for option A.\n\nOption B: direction vector is (6,10). Let's see if this is a multiple of (3,5). Let's divide each component by 3: 6/3 = 2, 10/3 ≈ 3.33. Hmm, 10/5 is 2. Wait, actually, 6/3 = 2 and 10/5 = 2, so yes, 6 is 2*3 and 10 is 2*5. So yes, (6,10) is a scalar multiple (2) of (3,5). So direction is correct for option B.\n\nOption C: direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's see if (3/5, 1) is a multiple of (3,5). Let's set up the ratios: (3/5)/3 = (1/5) and 1/5 = 1/5. So both components are multiplied by 1/5. Therefore, yes, (3/5, 1) is a scalar multiple (1/5) of (3,5). So direction is correct for option C.\n\nOption D: direction vector is (1, 3/5). Let's see if this is a multiple of (3,5). Let's set up the ratios: 1/3 ≈ 0.333 and (3/5)/5 = (3/5)/5 = 3/25 ≈ 0.12. These are not equal, so this vector is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). Therefore, the direction is incorrect for option D.\n\nOption E: direction vector is (15, -25). Let's check if this is a multiple of (3,5). Let's divide each component by 3: 15/3 = 5, -25/5 = -5. Hmm, so the scaling factor for the x-component is 5 and for the y-component is -5. Since the scaling factors aren't the same, (15, -25) isn't a scalar multiple of (3,5). So direction is incorrect for option E.\n\nAlright, so only options A, B, C have the correct direction vectors, while D and E have incorrect direction vectors.\n\nNow, moving on to the first part: each parameterization must pass through a point that lies on the given line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nSo I need to check for each option whether the initial point (when t = 0) satisfies the equation.\n\nOption A: initial point is (4, 1). Plug x = 4 into the line equation: y = (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = (20/3) - (17/3) = 3/3 = 1. So yes, when t = 0, y = 1. Therefore, (4,1) is on the line. So option A is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption B: initial point is (17, 5). Let's plug x = 17 into the line equation: y = (5/3)*17 - 17/3 = (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666, which is not equal to 5. Therefore, (17,5) is not on the line, so option B is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on: Is that correct? Let me compute (5/3)*17 -17/3: 5/3*17 is 85/3, subtract 17/3: 85/3 -17/3 = (85 -17)/3 = 68/3. 68 divided by 3 is approximately 22.666..., which is definitely not 5. So yes, option B's initial point is not on the line. Therefore, invalid.\n\nOption C: initial point is (2, -7/3). Let's plug x = 2 into the line equation: y = (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3. So y = -7/3, which matches the initial point. So (2, -7/3) is on the line. Therefore, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption D: initial point is (14/5, -1). Let's plug x = 14/5 into the line equation: y = (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3. Simplify: (5/3)*(14/5) = 14/3. Then subtract 17/3: 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So y = -1, which matches the initial point. So (14/5, -1) is on the line. Therefore, option D's initial point is correct. But wait, earlier I concluded the direction vector was incorrect. So is option D a valid parameterization? The direction vector was (1, 3/5), which isn't a multiple of (3,5). So, even if the initial point is on the line, the direction vector isn't correct. So parameterization D has the wrong direction, so it's invalid, even though the initial point is correct.\n\nWait, so if the direction vector is wrong, that's a problem, right? So even if it starts on the line, if it's moving in the wrong direction, then it's not the correct parameterization of the line.\n\nSimilarly, for option E: let's just check, though we already saw direction vector is wrong. The initial point is (0, -17/3). Plug x = 0 into the line equation: y = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3, which matches. So initial point is on the line, but the direction vector is wrong. So E is invalid.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n- Option A: correct direction, correct initial point. Valid.\n- Option B: wrong initial point. Invalid.\n- Option C: correct direction, correct initial point. Valid.\n- Option D: correct initial point, wrong direction vector. Invalid.\n- Option E: wrong direction vector, correct initial point. Invalid.\n\nWait, but the initial problem says \"the line y = 5/3 x - 17/3 is to be parameterized using vectors.\" So the vector should lie on that line, but for a parameterization to represent the entire line, both the initial point and direction vector must be appropriate.\n\nSo yeah, just confirming, for each parameterization, you need both:\n\n1. The initial point lies on the line.\n\n2. The direction vector is a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector (which is (3,5)).\n\nSo in that case, options A, B, C meet the second condition, but of these, only A and C have initial points on the line. Option B's initial point is not on the line, so it's invalid. Option D has the correct direction vector, but wrong initial point (actually, initial point is on the line, but direction is wrong), so invalid.\n\nWait no, hold on. Wait, for option D: the initial point is (14/5, -1). When we plug into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3\n\nSo, plugging x = 14/5, we have:\n\ny = (5/3)*(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - (17/3) = (-3)/3 = -1, which is correct.\n\nSo initial point is on the line, but the direction vector is not a multiple of (3,5). So that parameterization is moving in the wrong direction, but still lies on the line. Wait, so does that mean it's still a valid parameterization?\n\nWait, let's think. A parameterization of a line is given by a point on the line and a direction vector. It can be in any direction, but if it's for a specific line, I think the direction vector has to be parallel to the given line.\n\nWait, so in this case, the line has direction vector (3,5). So a parameterization must have a direction vector scalar multiple of that.\n\nIf you have a parameterization that has the correct initial point but a wrong direction vector, it's a different line.\n\nSo for example, if you take the point (0, -17/3) and add a direction vector (1,1), that's a different line, even though it starts on the original line.\n\nSo the parameterization is only valid if both conditions are satisfied: initial point on the given line, and direction vector parallel.\n\nTherefore, option D's initial point is on the line, but direction vector (1, 3/5) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). So, (1, 3/5) is not parallel to (3,5), so even though the initial point is on the line, the parameterization is not of the given line because it's moving in a different direction. Therefore, it's not a valid parameterization of the given line.\n\nSimilarly, option E has initial point on the line but direction vector is not correct, so invalid.\n\nSo going back, only options A, B, C. But of these, B is incorrect because the initial point is not on the line.\n\nSo actually, correct parameterizations are only A and C.\n\nWait, option D: initial point is on the line, but direction vector isn't. Option E: same.\n\nSo in conclusion, options A, C are valid.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check:\n\nOption A: initial point (4,1) is on the line because plugging x = 4 into the line equation gives y = 1. Direction vector is (-3,-5), which is a scalar multiple of (3,5) because multiplying by -1 gives (-3,-5). So it's valid.\n\nOption C: initial point (2, -7/3). Plugging x=2 into line equation: y = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3, which matches. Direction vector is (3/5,1). Is this a multiple of (3,5)?\n\nLet me check: If we have a direction vector (a, b), then if b/a = 5/3, it's parallel. So for direction vector (3/5, 1), let's compute b/a: (1)/(3/5) = 5/3. So yes, direction vector is parallel. Therefore, direction is correct. So option C is valid.\n\nSo that's A, C, D? Wait, no, D has initial point on line but direction incorrect, so invalid. So actually, only A and C are valid.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Earlier, when I thought about the direction vectors:\n\nOption D: direction vector (1, 3/5). So if we have (1, 3/5), is that a multiple of (3,5)?\n\nLet me see: If (1, 3/5) = k*(3,5), then 1 = 3k, and 3/5 = 5k.\n\nFrom the first equation, k = 1/3. Then from the second equation, 5k = 5*(1/3) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666, but in direction vector it's 3/5 = 0.6. So 5k ≈ 1.666 ≠ 0.6. Therefore, inconsistent, so direction vector is not a multiple of (3,5). So invalid.\n\nSimilarly for E: direction vector (15, -25). If we think about whether that's a multiple of (3,5). Let's check: 15/3 =5, -25/5 = -5. So inconsistent scaling factors, so not a multiple.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C.\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check.\n\nIs there a case where a direction vector is not a multiple, but still can represent the same line?\n\nWell, if the direction vector is a scalar multiple, then yes. If it's not, the line of the parameterization will have a different slope, so it's a different line.\n\nSo for example, a parameterization with initial point (0, -17/3) and direction vector (15, -25). Let's compute the slope: -25/15 = -5/3, which is different from the slope 5/3. So it's a different line.\n\nTherefore, only parameterizations where both the initial point is on the line and direction vector is a multiple of (3,5) are correct.\n\nThus, only options A and C are valid.\n\nWait, but I think I confused D and E earlier.\n\nWait, initial point for D is (14/5, -1). Let me compute 14/5 as 2.8, and plugging into the line equation: (5/3)(14/5) -17/3 = (14/3) - (17/3) = -3/3 = -1. So yes, correct.\n\nBut direction vector is (1, 3/5). Wait, 1 is 1, 3/5 is 0.6. So slope is 3/5, but the given line has slope 5/3. So that direction vector is slope 3/5, which is different.\n\nTherefore, even though the initial point is on the line, it's not parameterizing the correct line because the direction is different.\n\nSimilarly, for E, initial point is on the line, but direction is -5/3, which is not 5/3.\n\nSo only A and C.\n\nWait, but hold on. For the direction vector (3/5,1), is that correct? Let me confirm if it's a scalar multiple of (3,5). \n\nSo if we multiply (3,5) by 1/5, we get (3/5,1), which is exactly the direction vector in option C. So yes, direction vector in C is a scalar multiple (1/5) of (3,5). Therefore, valid.\n\nSo final conclusion: Options A and C are correct.\n\nBut wait, when I looked at option D: initial point is (14/5, -1) which is on the line, and the direction vector is (1, 3/5), which is not a scalar multiple, but maybe the direction vector is a multiple if I scale it differently? Let's see.\n\nWait, to see if direction vector (1, 3/5) is a scalar multiple of (3,5), let's suppose:\n\n1 = 3k\n\n3/5 = 5k\n\nFrom first equation, k = 1/3. Then, in second equation, 5k = 5*(1/3) = 5/3, which is not equal to 3/5. Therefore, no solution. Therefore, direction vector is not a scalar multiple, so invalid.\n\nSo yes, only options A and C.\n\nBut wait, wait a second, in the problem statement, the line is y = 5/3 x -17/3. So actually, the direction vector can also be represented as (3,5), since slope is rise over run, 5/3.\n\nBut in option C, the direction vector is (3/5,1), which is (3/5, 1). The slope is 1 divided by 3/5, which is 1/(3/5) = 5/3. So yes, it's also a direction vector with slope 5/3, so it's correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's options A and C.\n\nBut let me check my calculations once more to make sure I haven't messed up.\n\nFor option A: initial point (4,1). Plug into line: y = 5/3 x -17/3.\n\nCompute 5/3 *4: 20/3 ≈ 6.666, subtract 17/3 ≈ 5.666, so 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So y=1, correct.\n\nDirection vector (-3,-5). The slope is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3,",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represent the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\). The options are labeled (A) through (E), each providing a starting point (a point on the line) and a direction vector. My task is to figure out which of these options correctly parameterizes the given line. \n\nFirst off, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally given by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, for each option, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Does the starting point (when \\( t = 0 \\)) lie on the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\)? \n2. Is the direction vector a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the given line? \n\nIf both conditions are satisfied for an option, then that option is a valid parameterization of the line.\n\nLet me recall that the slope of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) is \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). Therefore, the direction vector of the line should have components that reflect this slope. Specifically, the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) should satisfy \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{5}{3} \\). \n\nAlternatively, the direction vector can be written as any scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) because \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) is the slope. So, any direction vector that's a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) should be acceptable.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):** \n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if (4,1) lies on the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\).\n\nPlugging x = 4 into the equation: \n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\). \n\nYes, y is 1, which matches the starting point (4,1). So, the starting point is on the line.\n\nNext, check if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). \n\nLooking at option (A)'s direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). \n\nThis is just -1 times the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, yes, it's a scalar multiple. \n\nTherefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):** \n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if (17,5) is on the line.\n\nPlugging x = 17 into the equation:\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.6667 \\)\n\nBut the starting y-value is 5, which is not equal to \\( \\frac{68}{3} \\). Therefore, the starting point is not on the line. \n\nSince the starting point is incorrect, we can stop here and say option (B) is not valid.\n\n**Option (C):** \n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nPlugging x = 2 into the equation:\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\)\n\nSo, y = -7/3, which matches the starting point (2, -7/3). Therefore, the starting point is correct.\n\nNext, check if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nThe direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's see if there's a scalar k such that:\n\\( 3/5 = 3k \\) and \\( 1 = 5k \\).\n\nFrom the second equation: \\( 1 = 5k \\) => \\( k = 1/5 \\).\n\nCheck the first equation: \\( 3/5 = 3*(1/5) = 3/5 \\). Yes, it satisfies.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is a scalar multiple (specifically, 1/5 times) the correct direction vector. \n\nSo, option (C) is also a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):** \n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) which is (2.8, -1)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nPlugging x = 14/5 into the equation:\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}*(14/5) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{3}{3} = -1 \\)\n\nSo, y = -1, which matches the starting point (14/5, -1). Starting point is correct.\n\nNext, check the direction vector.\n\nWe need to see if \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nLet's see if there's a scalar k such that:\n1 = 3k and 3/5 = 5k\n\nFrom the first equation: k = 1/3\n\nPlug into the second equation: 5*(1/3) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667, but the second component is 3/5 = 0.6. \n\nThese are not equal. So, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a scalar multiple of another direction vector, but let's check the slope. The direction vector is (1, 3/5). So, the slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, which is different from the line's slope of 5/3.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Actually, in the direction vector, the slope is rise over run, so (Δy)/(Δx) = (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But our line has a slope of 5/3, which is the reciprocal. Therefore, the direction vector (1, 3/5) is actually perpendicular to the direction vector we need, since their slopes multiply to (5/3)*(3/5) = 1, which is characteristic of perpendicular lines, not parallel.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is not correct. Hence, option (D) is not a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (E):** \n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nPlugging x = 0 into the equation:\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3} \\)\n\nWhich matches the starting point (0, -17/3). So, starting point is correct.\n\nNext, check the direction vector.\n\nWe need to see if \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nLet's see:\n\nSuppose \\( 15 = 3k \\) and \\( -25 = 5k \\).\n\nFrom the first equation: k = 15/3 = 5.\n\nCheck the second equation: 5k = 5*5 = 25. But in the direction vector, the second component is -25, which is -25 = 5k => k = -5.\n\nBut k cannot be both 5 and -5 at the same time. Therefore, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the correct direction vector. \n\nAlternatively, let's check the slope. The direction vector is (15, -25), so the slope is Δy/Δx = (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nBut our line has a slope of 5/3, so this direction vector actually points in the opposite direction but with the same magnitude in slope's absolute value. However, the sign is different, so it's not the correct direction. \n\nWait, actually, a direction vector's slope doesn't need to be positive? No, direction vectors can point in any direction, but in this case, the line's slope is positive, so the direction vector should have a positive slope as well. Therefore, a direction vector with a negative slope is incorrect for this line.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is not a valid parameterization.\n\nTo recap:\n\n- Option (A): Starting point on line, direction vector correct multiple. Valid.\n- Option (B): Starting point not on line. Invalid.\n- Option (C): Starting point on line, direction vector correct multiple. Valid.\n- Option (D): Starting point on line, but direction vector slope wrong. Invalid.\n- Option (E): Starting point on line, direction vector slope wrong. Invalid.\n\nTherefore, the valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid options are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nHowever, according to the problem statement, I need to enter the letters separated by commas within a single box. Since the user initially requested \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n\n**Note:** In the problem, the starting point for option (D) might have been miscalculated earlier. Wait, let's double-check option (D). Wait, in my initial calculation, for option (D), starting point was (14/5, -1). So plugging in x = 14/5:\n\n\\( y = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1 \\). Correct.\n\nBut the direction vector (1, 3/5). The slope is 3/5, which is not equal to the line's slope of 5/3. So the direction is incorrect. Correct, so not valid.\n\nYes, so earlier conclusion stands. Options (A) and (C) are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two conditions for each option: \n\n1. The starting point (when \\( t = 0 \\)) lies on the line.\n2. The direction vector is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (or its scalar multiple, ensuring the slope is \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\)).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option (A):**\n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Starting point lies on the line.\n- Direction vector is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (specifically, -1 times).\n- Valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Starting point does not lie on the line.\n- Invalid parameterization.\n\n**Option (C):**\n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Starting point lies on the line.\n- Direction vector is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (specifically, \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) times).\n- Valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):**\n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Starting point lies on the line.\n- Direction vector does not have the correct slope (reciprocal slope instead of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\)).\n- Invalid parameterization.\n\n**Option (E):**\n- Starting point: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- Starting point lies on the line.\n- Direction vector does not have the correct slope (negative slope instead of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\)).\n- Invalid parameterization.\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A,C}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I need to figure out which of these options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations for the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay. I remember that a parameterization of a line needs two things: a point on the line and a direction vector that's parallel to the line.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the general form of a parameterization is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a specific point on the line, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a direction vector for the line. So, to verify each option, I need to check two things:\n\n1. The given point \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) must lie on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n2. The direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) must be parallel to the line, which in this case, since the slope is 5/3, the direction vector should have a slope equivalent to 5/3 or be a scalar multiple of it.\n\nSo, let me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (4, 1) lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nCalculating y from the point:\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3\n= 20/3 - 17/3\n= 3/3\n= 1\n\nYes, that works, so the point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The direction vector here is (-3, -5). To see if it's parallel, it needs to have a slope equal to the line's slope, which is 5/3.\n\nSlope of the direction vector is rise over run: (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which matches the line's slope. So, the direction vector is correct.\n\nSo, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCheck if (17, 5) is on the line.\n\nCompute y from x: (5/3)(17) - 17/3\n= (85/3) - 17/3\n= 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\n\nBut the y given is 5. 5 ≈ 15/3, so 15/3 vs. 68/3. That's not equal. Therefore, the point (17, 5) is not on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, Option B is invalid because the point doesn't lie on the line.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\n(5/3)*17 = 85/3, right? And 85/3 - 17/3 = (85 - 17)/3 = 68/3. So 68/3 is approximately 22.666, which isn't 5. So, yeah, definitely not on the line. So, Option B is out.\n\n**Option C:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nCompute y from x: (5/3)(2) - 17/3\n= 10/3 - 17/3\n= (-7)/3\n\nWhich is exactly -7/3. So, that point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The direction vector is (3/5, 1). What's the slope here? 1 divided by (3/5) is 1*(5/3) = 5/3. So, slope is 5/3, which matches the line's slope. So, the direction vector is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCheck if (14/5, -1) lies on the line.\n\nCompute y from x: (5/3)*(14/5) - 17/3\nSimplify: (5 cancels with 5) 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1\n\nWhich is exactly -1, so the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (1, 3/5). The slope here is (3/5)/1 = 3/5.\n\nWait, the original line has a slope of 5/3, not 3/5. So, the direction vector's slope is the reciprocal. Hmm, is that acceptable?\n\nWait, no. Because if the line's slope is 5/3, then the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 or a multiple of that. A direction vector (1, 3/5) has a slope of 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3.\n\nBut are they scalar multiples? Let's see: If you scale (1, 3/5) by 5, you get (5, 3). The slope of that vector is 3/5, which is still not 5/3.\n\nSo, (1, 3/5) doesn't have a slope equal to 5/3. Therefore, the direction vector is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I can check if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of a vector with slope 5/3.\n\nWait, slope of direction vector is 3/5, which is 3/5, not 5/3. So, they are reciprocals but not same. So, it's not a scalar multiple. Therefore, the direction vector is not parallel to the given line.\n\nHence, Option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nCompute y from x: (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3. Yep, that matches the given point.\n\nNow, check the direction vector (15, -25). What's the slope here? (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nWait, the original line has a slope of 5/3, but here, the direction vector has a slope of -5/3. So, that would mean the direction is opposite. So, does that matter?\n\nWell, the slope is negative. So, is a direction vector with slope -5/3 acceptable?\n\nWait, no, because the direction vector of the line should have the same slope as the line's slope. Since the line has a slope of 5/3, the direction vector must have a slope of 5/3 or a multiple of that. Here, slope is -5/3, which is not the same. So, is it acceptable?\n\nWait, actually, direction vectors can have negative slopes as long as they are scalar multiples of the original direction. But in this case, even though it's a scalar multiple, the slope is negative. So, is that a problem?\n\nHmm, wait. The line is y = (5/3)x -17/3, so it's going upwards to the right. So, a direction vector should have a positive slope. A direction vector with a negative slope would go downwards to the right, which would still be a valid direction vector for the line if you allow for negative multiples. But wait, direction vectors can be in either direction. So, if the slope is negative, it's still a valid direction vector, but it would just be a direction opposite to the positive slope direction. However, if the line is given, the direction vector's slope just needs to match the line's slope, regardless of sign? Wait, actually, if the line is y = (5/3)x -17/3, then a direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 or any non-zero scalar multiple, regardless of direction? Wait, no, because if you reverse the direction vector, the slope remains the same in magnitude but negative. So, no, that might be the issue.\n\nWait, let's see: The direction vector of the line can be any vector whose slope is equal to the slope of the line. However, in this case, the direction vector has a slope of (-25)/15 = -5/3. The line has a slope of 5/3. So, the direction vector's slope is the negative of the line's slope, which is a problem because it's not a scalar multiple.\n\nWait, scalar multiples would change the magnitude but not the direction of the slope. So, if I take a vector (15, -25), and I reverse its direction by multiplying by -1, I get (-15, 25). That vector would have a slope of 25/(-15) = -5/3, which is still negative. So, it's not a positive multiple of the slope.\n\nTherefore, this direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the slope of the line. Therefore, it's incorrect.\n\nHence, Option E is invalid.\n\nWait, let me confirm that.\n\nSuppose we have a direction vector (a, b). For the line to have slope 5/3, we need b/a = 5/3, or a/b = 3/5, but in direction vector, it's defined as (change in x, change in y). So, slope is (change in y)/(change in x). So, it should be 5/3.\n\nSo, for the direction vector (15, -25), (change in y)/(change in x) is (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is not 5/3.\n\nSo, indeed, that's not a valid direction vector. So, Option E is invalid.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nOption A: Valid\nOption B: Invalid\nOption C: Valid\nOption D: Invalid\nOption E: Invalid\n\nSo, the valid options are A and C.\n\nBut let me double-check option C's direction vector.\n\nDirection vector: (3/5, 1). So, change in y is 1, change in x is 3/5. Therefore, slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, yeah, it's a valid direction vector.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me parameterize the line differently.\n\nIf the line is y = (5/3)x -17/3, then any point on the line can be expressed as (x0, (5/3)x0 -17/3) and direction vector (3, 5). Because if you have x increasing by 3, y increases by 5, which maintains the slope of 5/3.\n\nAlternatively, scaling the direction vector: say, (6, 10), but that would make the slope 10/6 = 5/3 as well.\n\nSo, in Option A, the direction vector is (-3, -5), which is just scaling down (3,5) by a factor of -1. So, it's in the opposite direction, but still valid because direction vectors can point in either direction as long as they are scalar multiples.\n\nWait, so is direction vector (3,5) and (-3, -5) considered the same direction? Or are they different?\n\nActually, they are scalar multiples. So, if you allow the parameter t to be positive or negative, both directions are valid. So, both (3,5) and (-3, -5) are valid direction vectors.\n\nTherefore, Option A's direction vector is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for Option C: (3/5, 1) is a direction vector with slope 5/3. Similarly, (-3/5, -1) would also be a valid direction vector.\n\nSo, yes, both A and C have correct direction vectors.\n\nWait, what about Option E? If someone scales the direction vector (15, -25) by -1, you get (-15, 25), which still has a slope of 25/(-15) = -5/3, which is still different from 5/3. So, the direction vector's slope is negative, so even if you reverse the direction, it's still not matching the slope of the line.\n\nSo, yes, Option E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that options A and C are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid options are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two conditions for each option: \n1.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations (A to E) correctly parameterize the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, parameterizing a line means representing it in terms of a point on the line and a direction vector. \n\nFirst, let me recall that a parameterization of a line in the plane is generally given by a point on the line plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, the general form is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwhere (x₀, y₀) is a point on the line and (a, b) is the direction vector.\n\nNow, to check if each option is a valid parameterization, I need to ensure two things:\n1. The initial point (when t=0) lies on the line.\n2. The direction vector is parallel to the line, meaning it has the same slope as the line.\n\nGiven the line equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3, the slope is 5/3. So, the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3. \n\nLet me compute the slope of each direction vector in the options.\n\nStarting with option (A):\nDirection vector is (-3, -5). Let's find its slope. The slope would be rise over run, so (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. That's correct because 5/3 is the slope of our line. \n\nNow, check if the point (4,1) lies on the line. Plugging into the equation:\ny = (5/3)x - 17/3\nLeft side y = 1\nRight side: (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1\nSo, yes, (4,1) is on the line. Therefore, option A is valid.\n\nMoving to option (B):\nDirection vector is (6,10). Slope is 10/6 = 5/3. That's good.\n\nCheck if (17,5) is on the line:\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3\nCalculating:\n(5/3)(17) = 85/3\n85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\nBut the y-coordinate is 5, which is approximately 15/3. 68/3 ≈ 22.666 is not equal to 5. So, this point does not lie on the line. Therefore, option B is not valid.\n\nOption (C):\nDirection vector is (3/5, 1). Let me find the slope: 1 divided by (3/5) is 1*(5/3) = 5/3. So, slope is correct.\n\nCheck if the point (2, -7/3) is on the line:\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = (-7)/3. Which is exactly -7/3. So, yes, it is on the line. Therefore, option C is valid.\n\nOption (D):\nDirection vector is (1, 3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But our line has a slope of 5/3, so 3/5 is the reciprocal. That means the direction vector is not parallel to the line. Therefore, option D is invalid because the direction is wrong.\n\nWait, hold on. Alternatively, I could think about whether the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the slope of the line.\n\nThe direction vector (1, 3/5) has a slope of (3/5)/1 = 3/5, but our line's slope is 5/3, which is the reciprocal. They are not scalar multiples of each other, unless 3/5 = k*(5/3) for some scalar k. But solving 3/5 = (5/3)k gives k = (3/5)*(3/5) = 9/25, which doesn't satisfy because (5/3)*(9/25) = (45)/75 = 3/5, which is correct, but only if we scale the direction vector. But wait, does scaling the direction vector change the line? Or is it about the direction regardless of scaling?\n\nHmm, no. The direction vector has a specific slope. So, if the direction vector's slope is not equal to the line's slope, it's not parallel. Therefore, it's incorrect. So, option D is invalid.\n\nOption (E):\nDirection vector is (15, -25). Slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3. Wait, the slope is -5/3, whereas the line's slope is 5/3. So, it's the negative reciprocal. That means it's not parallel but perpendicular to the line. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nWait, unless the direction vector is a scalar multiple with a negative, but direction vectors can be in the opposite direction but still considered parallel if they are scalar multiples regardless of the sign.\n\nBut no, in terms of direction, the direction vector's slope should exactly match the line's slope. If it's negative, even if it's a scalar multiple, unless the scalar is negative, it won't result in the same direction. But in the context of parametric equations, the direction can be either direction, so as long as the slope matches. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider. If the direction vector's slope is -5/3, which is the negative of the line's slope. Since slope is a signed value, depending on how the parameterization is done, a direction vector with a negative slope can still be a valid parameterization if it's a scalar multiple with a negative scalar. But in our case, the slope is positive, but this direction vector has a negative slope, so it's not parallel. \n\nSo, option E is invalid.\n\nWait, let me confirm: If the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector, then it's parallel. For the line, the direction vector could be (3,5) because slope is 5/3. So, direction vector (3,5) or any scalar multiple. But direction vector (15, -25) is a scalar multiple with a negative sign, meaning it's in the opposite direction. But since it's still a scalar multiple, is that considered parallel?\n\nI think in terms of lines, if the direction vector is a scalar multiple (regardless of sign), the line is considered parallel. So, even if the direction vector is in the opposite direction, it's still considered a valid direction for the parameterization.\n\nBut wait, in the context of parametric equations, direction vectors that are scalar multiples, whether positive or negative, still result in the same line, just traversed in opposite directions.\n\nSo, actually, is direction vector (15, -25) a valid direction?\n\nGiven that 15/-25 is -3/5, which is -5/3 reciprocal.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute the direction vector for the line is slope 5/3, so the direction vector is (3,5). If someone provides (15, -25), which has a slope of (-25)/15 = -5/3, so that's a different direction, not a scalar multiple of (3,5).\n\nWait, let me think algebraically. If you have two vectors, they are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. So, is (15, -25) a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's check.\n\nSuppose (15, -25) = k*(3,5). Then, 15 = 3k and -25 = 5k.\n\nFrom the first equation, 15 = 3k ⇒ k = 5.\n\nFrom the second equation, -25 = 5k ⇒ k = -5.\n\nSince k is not the same, it's not a scalar multiple. Therefore, the direction vector (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5), so they are not parallel. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, among options A to E, A, C are valid, and B, D, E are invalid.\n\nWait, just to recap:\n\nA: Correct initial point, correct direction vector slope.\n\nB: Correct direction, wrong initial point.\n\nC: Correct initial point, correct direction vector slope.\n\nD: Wrong initial point, wrong direction vector.\n\nE: Incorrect direction vector slope.\n\nHence, only A and C are valid parameterizations.\n\nBut wait, hold on! Let me double-check option C.\n\nOption C: The initial point is (2, -7/3). Plugging into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nSo, (5/3)*2 = 10/3. Then 10/3 - 17/3 = -7/3, which is exactly the y-coordinate. So, point C is correct.\n\nThe direction vector is (3/5,1). The slope is 1/(3/5)=5/3, which matches the line's slope.\n\nTherefore, yes, option C is valid.\n\nWait, but in the initial thinking for option C, the direction vector is (3/5,1). So, the change is 3/5 in x and 1 in y, so the rise over run is 1/(3/5)=5/3, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, option C is valid.\n\nIs there any other thing to check? For example, the parametrization might not pass through the point correctly.\n\nWait, for parametrization, let me pick t=0: x=2, y=-7/3, which is on the line. Good.\n\nIf I set t=1: x=2 + 3/5=13/5, y=-7/3 +1= -4/3.\n\nCheck if (13/5, -4/3) is on the line:\n\nCompute y = (5/3)*(13/5) -17/3 = (13/3) -17/3= (-4)/3, which matches. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, t=2: x=2 + 6/5=16/5, y=-7/3 + 2= (-7/3 +6/3)= -1/3.\n\nCheck: (5/3)*(16/5)=16/3, 16/3 -17/3= -1/3. Correct. \n\nSo, option C is valid.\n\nSimilarly, let's check option A:\n\nPoint at t=0 is (4,1). On the line? y=5/3*4 -17/3=20/3 -17/3=3/3=1. Correct.\n\nDirection vector: (-3,-5). Slope is (-5)/(-3)=5/3, which is correct.\n\nCheck another point: t=1: x=4-3=1, y=1-5=-4.\n\nCheck y=(5/3)*1 -17/3=5/3 -17/3= -12/3=-4. Correct.\n\nSo, option A is valid.\n\nTherefore, I think only options A and C are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two conditions for each parameterization: the initial point lies on the line, and the direction vector has the same slope as the line (5/3).\n\n1. **Option (A)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check if it lies on the line: \\( 1 = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot 4 - \\frac{17}{3} \\Rightarrow 1 = 1 \\).

                "full_response": "Alright, so I need to figure out which of these parameterizations (A to E) correctly represent the line given by the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay. I remember that a parameterization of a line generally needs two things: a point on the line and a direction vector. The direction vector should be in the direction of the line's slope.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation of the line in a more familiar form. It's already given as y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, the slope of the line is 5/3, right? That means the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3 as well. In vector terms, if I have a direction vector, say <a, b>, then b/a should equal 5/3. So, I can check each option to see if their direction vectors have this slope.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: the direction vector is < -3, -5>. So, the slope would be (-5)/(-3) which simplifies to 5/3. That matches the slope of our line. So, the direction vector is okay for option A.\n\nNow, let's check if the point in option A is actually on the line. The point given is (4, 1). Plugging x=4 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(4) - 17/3. Calculating that: (20/3) - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So, y = 1 when x=4. Therefore, the point (4, 1) is indeed on the line. So, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to Option B: direction vector <6, 10>. The slope here is 10/6, which simplifies to 5/3. Again, that's correct. Now, check if the point (17, 5) is on the line. Plugging x=17 into y = (5/3)x - 17/3: (5/3)*17 is 85/3, subtracting 17/3 gives 68/3, which is approximately 22.666... But the y-value is given as 5, which doesn't match 68/3. So, that means option B's point isn't on the line. Therefore, option B isn't a valid parameterization.\n\nNext is Option C: direction vector <3/5, 1>. Calculating the slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. So, that's correct. Now, check the point (2, -7/3). Plugging x=2 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(2) - 17/3. That is 10/3 - 17/3 = -7/3. So, y = -7/3 when x=2. Therefore, the point (2, -7/3) is on the line. So, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption D: direction vector <1, 3/5>. Let's find the slope: (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, that's 3/5, which is not equal to the slope of our line, which is 5/3. So, the direction vector is in the wrong direction. Hmm, but let me double-check: slope is 3/5? Wait, direction vector components are <1, 3/5>, so yes, it's a slope of 3/5. That doesn't match 5/3. So, even if the point was on the line, the direction is incorrect. Therefore, option D is invalid.\n\nOption E: direction vector <15, -25>. Calculating the slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3. That's a slope of -5/3, which is the negative of our line's slope. Since the line is supposed to have a slope of 5/3, this direction vector is in the opposite direction. Even if the point was on the line, the direction is wrong, so it's not a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, but let me check if the point in option E is on the line. The point is (0, -17/3). Plugging x=0 into the line equation: y = (5/3)(0) -17/3 = -17/3. So, yes, the point (0, -17/3) is on the line. However, the direction vector is incorrect because it gives the wrong slope. Therefore, option E is also invalid.\n\nSo, summarizing my findings:\n\n- Option A: correct slope and point on the line. Valid.\n- Option B: correct slope but incorrect point. Invalid.\n- Option C: correct slope and point on the line. Valid.\n- Option D: incorrect slope and point? Wait, wait, let me check the point again for option D.\n\nOption D's point is (14/5, -1). Hmm, 14/5 is 2.8. Plugging into the line equation: y = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3. Simplify: (5/3)*(14/5) is 14/3. Then 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So, yes, the point (14/5, -1) is on the line. But the direction vector is <1, 3/5>, which has a slope of 3/5, not 5/3. So, the direction is wrong, making the parameterization invalid.\n\nSo, only options A and C have both the correct slope and a point on the line. Option E's direction is wrong but point is correct, but since it's not a valid direction, it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the valid parameterizations are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check both the point on the line and the direction vector for each parameterization.\n\n1. **Option A**:\n   - Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n     - Slope: \\(\\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\\) (correct)\n   - Point: \\((4, 1)\\)\n     - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\) (correct)\n   - Valid parameterization.\n\n2. **Option B**:\n   - Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n     - Slope: \\(\\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}\\) (correct)\n   - Point: \\((17, 5)\\)\n     - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\neq 5 \\) (incorrect)\n   - Invalid parameterization.\n\n3. **Option C**:\n   - Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n     - Slope: \\(\\frac{1}{3/5} = \\frac{5}{3}\\) (correct)\n   - Point: \\((2, -7/3)\\)\n     - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) (correct)\n   - Valid parameterization.\n\n4. **Option D**:\n   - Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n     - Slope: \\(\\frac{3/5}{1} = \\frac{3}{5}\\) (incorrect)\n   - Point: \\((14/5, -1)\\)\n     - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(14/5) - \\frac{17}{3} = -1 \\) (correct)\n   - Invalid parameterization due to incorrect slope.\n\n5. **Option E**:\n   - Direction vector: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n     - Slope: \\(\\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3}\\) (incorrect)\n   - Point: \\((0, -17/3)\\)\n     - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3} \\) (correct)\n   - Invalid parameterization due to incorrect slope.\n\nThe valid parameterizations are \\(\\boxed{A}\\) and \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations correctly parameterizes the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The options are labeled (A) through (E), each providing a starting point and a direction vector for the parameterization. \n\nFirst, let me recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally given by r = r₀ + t*v, where r₀ is a specific point on the line (the initial point), v is a direction vector, and t is a scalar parameter. For this parameterization to be correct for the given line, two conditions must be satisfied:\n\n1. The initial point r₀ must lie on the line.\n2. The direction vector v must be parallel to the line, meaning it should have the same slope as the line itself.\n\nGiven the line equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3, the slope of this line is 5/3. Therefore, the direction vector for any correct parameterization must have components such that the slope between the components is 5/3. In other words, if the direction vector is (a, b), then b/a should equal 5/3, or simplified, 5/3. This gives us a key condition to check for each option.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (A):\n- Initial point: (4, 1)\n- Direction vector: (-3, -5)\n\nFirst, check if (4, 1) is on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Plugging x = 4 into the line equation:\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = (20/3) - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1\nSo, yes, (4, 1) is on the line. That's good.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The slope from the direction vector components (-3, -5) is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which matches the slope of the line. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n- Initial point: (17, 5)\n- Direction vector: (6, 10)\n\nFirst, check if (17, 5) is on the line:\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3\nCalculate step by step:\n(5/3)*17 = 85/3\n85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\nBut the y-coordinate is 5, which is approximately 15/3. Clearly, 68/3 ≠ 15/3, so the point (17, 5) is not on the line.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me recalculate:\n(5/3)*17 = (5*17)/3 = 85/3 ≈ 28.333...\nThen subtract 17/3: 28.333... - 5.666... ≈ 22.666..., which is definitely not 5. So yeah, the point (17,5) is not on the line. Therefore, option (B) is invalid since it doesn't even start on the line.\n\nOption (C):\n- Initial point: (2, -7/3)\n- Direction vector: (3/5, 1)\n\nFirst, let's check if (2, -7/3) is on the line. Plugging x = 2 into the line equation:\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = (10/3) - 17/3 = (-7)/3\nWhich is exactly the y-coordinate given. So, yes, the initial point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The slope is (1) / (3/5) = 1 * (5/3) = 5/3. Perfect, same slope as the line.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption (D):\n- Initial point: (14/5, -1)\n- Direction vector: (1, 3/5)\n\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line. Let me compute the line's y when x = 14/5.\n\ny = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3\nSimplify:\n(5/3)*(14/5) = (14)/3 ≈ 4.666...\nSubtract 17/3 ≈ 5.666...\nSo, 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1\nWhich matches the y-coordinate given. So, the initial point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector: (1, 3/5). The slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, the slope of the line is 5/3, and the direction vector's slope is 3/5, which is the reciprocal and not equal. Therefore, this direction vector is not parallel to the line.\n\nIn fact, the direction vector (1, 3/5) points in a different direction, which would mean the parameterization is for a different line or even for a different part of this line. Since the slope doesn't match, it's not a valid parameterization for y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nSo, option (D) is invalid.\n\nOption (E):\n- Initial point: (0, -17/3)\n- Direction vector: (15, -25)\n\nFirst, check if the initial point (0, -17/3) is on the line. Plugging x = 0 into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*0 - 17/3 = -17/3\n\nWhich is exactly the y-coordinate. So, the initial point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector. The slope is (-25)/15. Simplifying this, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 5:\n\n-25/15 = (-5)/3\n\nSo, the slope here is -5/3. But the slope of the original line is 5/3. Since -5/3 is the negative reciprocal (i.e., negative and reciprocal in magnitude), this direction vector points in the opposite direction along the line. However, for a parameterization, as long as the direction vector is a scalar multiple (including negative) of the line's slope, it's still acceptable because it can go in either direction.\n\nWait a second. Let me clarify: In parameterizations, the direction vector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, positive or negative. So, as long as the direction is consistent with the line's slope, even in the opposite direction, it's acceptable.\n\nBut let me think again: If the slope of the line is positive (5/3), then any direction vector with slope positive 5/3 or negative 5/3 would still be valid because parameterizing a line can go in either direction.\n\nBut let me be precise. The direction vector's slope is 5/3 or -5/3? Let's compute:\n\nThe direction vector is (15, -25). So, the slope is rise over run, which is (-25)/15 = -5/3. So, the direction vector is in the direction where y decreases as x increases, which is the opposite direction of the line's slope, which is 5/3 (y increases as x increases). \n\nHowever, for a parameterization, as long as the direction vector is a scalar multiple of a direction vector that's parallel to the line, it's acceptable, regardless of the direction. So, even though the direction is opposite, it's still parallel because it's a scalar multiple (with a negative scalar) of the line's direction vector.\n\nWait, hold on. To clarify, a line's direction is determined by its direction vectors, which can be scaled in either the positive or negative direction. So, a direction vector of (a, b) is equivalent to any scalar multiple k*(a, b) where k ≠ 0. So, both (15, -25) and (3, -5) would be valid because they are scalar multiples of each other. \n\nBut let me also recall that the parameterization should correspond to the line's equation. So, the direction vector must have a slope equal to the line's slope or negative reciprocal? Wait, no, for parallel lines, the slopes have to be equal. For perpendicular lines, the slopes multiply to -1. So, in this case, since the line is slope 5/3, the direction vector must have slope equal to 5/3, regardless of whether it's positive or negative scaling.\n\nWait, no, not exactly. A direction vector can point in either direction along the line. So, if the line has a direction vector (a, b), then any multiple k*(a, b) where k is a scalar will give the same line, just traversed in the opposite direction when k is negative. However, the slope as direction vector is still a multiple; but for our purpose here, we need the slope as determined by the direction vector to be equal to the slope of the line.\n\nSo, given that the slope of the direction vector is -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3. Therefore, it's not a direction vector that is parallel to the original line.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine this. Let's see: If we have a direction vector (a, b), then the slope of the line it defines is b/a. If this equals 5/3, it's fine. If it's -5/3, that's a different direction vector, but it's still parallel because the slope is consistent with the line's equation.\n\nWait, is that right? For a line, the direction vector can be any non-zero scalar multiple. So, the slope of the direction vector should match the slope of the line.\n\nIn this case, the slope of the direction vector is -25/15 = -5/3, which is different from 5/3. So, the line of this direction vector is parallel, but the parameterization is going in the opposite direction.\n\nBut hold on, for a parameterization, even if you have a direction vector pointing in the opposite direction, the set of points covered by the parameterization is still the same line. So, would that be acceptable? Or does the slope have to exactly match? Let me think.\n\nSuppose I have a line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The direction vector (3,5) would give a slope of 5/3, which is correct. The direction vector (15,25) would also have a slope of 5/3, correct. The direction vector (15,-25) would have a slope of -25/15 = -5/3. \n\nSo, actually, if you use a direction vector with a negative reciprocal slope, that's perpendicular, not parallel. Wait, reciprocal with a negative sign. The negative reciprocal of 5/3 is -3/5, not -5/3. So, maybe I got something wrong.\n\nWait, let me compute reciprocals. The negative reciprocal of 5/3 is indeed -3/5. So, a slope of -3/5 is the negative reciprocal, so it's perpendicular. Whereas, the reciprocal of 5/3 is 3/5.\n\nSo, perhaps, a direction vector with slope 3/5 or -3/5 would be perpendicular to the original line.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me retrace.\n\nGiven a line with slope m, any direction vector with slope m is parallel to the line, right? So, direction vector (a, b) must satisfy b/a = m for it to be parallel.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector (a, b) must have a slope equal to m. If the direction vector has a slope different from m, either positive or negative, then the line defined by that direction vector is either not parallel or not the same line.\n\nTherefore, in the case of option (E), direction vector is (15, -25). The slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3 ≠ 5/3. Therefore, this direction vector is not parallel to the original line, hence the parameterization is not correct.\n\nWait, but maybe my confusion arises because we can have direction vectors in either direction, but regardless, they must maintain the same slope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that for a parameterization, you can have multiple direction vectors, as long as they are scalar multiples, regardless of direction? Hmm. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nIf a line has slope m, then any non-zero scalar multiple of (1, m) is a direction vector for that line. So, if m is 5/3, then (3,5) or (6,10) or (-3,-5) would all be valid direction vectors since they are scalar multiples of (1, 5/3). \n\nHowever, (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (1, 5/3). Because if we try to find a scalar k such that (1, 5/3)*k = (15, -25), that would require k =15 for the first component, but then 5/3 *15 =25, but the second component is -25, which doesn't match. So, this direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector, so it's not parallel, meaning it's a different direction.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is invalid because its direction vector is not parallel to the original line. Thus, the parameterization does not lie on y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nWait, but another perspective: the parametric equations can still represent the line, even if the direction vector is in the opposite direction. So, if a direction vector is a negative scalar multiple, the parameterization still represents the same line, but traversed in the opposite direction.\n\nSo, in that case, if (15, -25) is -5*(3,5), which is a scalar multiple, then perhaps this is still considered a valid parameterization. Hmm. Let me check that.\n\nLet me write the parametric equations for option (E):\n\nx = 0 + 15t\n\ny = -17/3 -25t\n\nIs this line the same as y = (5/3)x -17/3? Let me solve for y in terms of x and see.\n\nFrom the parametric equations:\n\nx =15t => t = x/15\n\nThen, substitute into y:\n\ny = -17/3 -25*(x/15) = -17/3 - (25/15)x = -17/3 - (5/3)x\n\nWhich is y = (-5/3)x -17/3\n\nComparing this with the original line equation, y = (5/3)x -17/3, they have different slopes: -5/3 vs. 5/3.\n\nSo, the line in option (E) has a different slope, hence it's a different line. Therefore, even though the direction vector is a scalar multiple, if it's in the opposite direction, the equation changes.\n\nThus, even though direction vector is a scalar multiple, the sign matters because it changes the slope. So, if you have (15, -25), which is (3*5, -5*5), which is 5*(3, -5). But (3, -5) is a direction vector with slope -5/3, which is not parallel to the original line. So, 5*(3, -5) is a direction vector with slope -5/3, which is different from 5/3.\n\nTherefore, the parameterization with direction vector (15, -25) does not represent the original line but another line with slope -5/3. So, it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is invalid.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Option (A): Correct, since initial point is on the line and direction vector has the same slope.\n- Option (B): Incorrect, initial point is not on the line.\n- Option (C): Correct, initial point is on the line and direction vector has the same slope.\n- Option (D): Incorrect, initial point is on the line, but direction vector has the wrong slope.\n- Option (E): Incorrect, initial point is on the line, but direction vector has the wrong slope, leading to a different line.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (C).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two conditions for each option: \n1.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about parameterizing a line, and I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations. The line is given by the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The missing condition was about parameterizing this line using vectors. Hmm, okay, let me think.\n\nFirst, I know that a parameterization of a line typically involves a point on the line and a direction vector. The general form is usually something like r(t) = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a specific point on the line and v is the direction vector. So, each of these options (A through E) is a vector equation, and I need to check if they actually represent the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nLet me write down the equation again: y = (5/3)x - 17/3. This is a straight line with slope 5/3 and y-intercept at -17/3. So, the direction vector should have a slope that matches the line's slope. That means if the direction vector is something like (a, b), then b/a should equal 5/3. So, I need to check each option for two things: does it pass through a point on the given line, and does the direction vector have the correct slope?\n\nLet me take them one by one.\n\nOption A: r(t) = [4, 1] + t[-3, -5].\n\nFirst, let's check if the point (4,1) is on the line. Plugging x = 4 into the equation, y should be (5/3)*4 - 17/3. That's (20/3 - 17/3) = 3/3 = 1. So, yes, (4,1) is on the line. Now, the direction vector is [-3, -5]. The slope here would be rise over run, which is -5/-3 = 5/3. Perfect, that's the same as the slope of the line. So, both the point is on the line and the direction vector has the correct slope. Therefore, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption B: r(t) = [17, 5] + t[6, 10].\n\nFirst, check if (17, 5) is on the line. Let's compute y when x =17: y = (5/3)*17 - 17/3. That's (85/3 - 17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666..., which is not equal to 5. So, (17,5) is not on the line. Therefore, even though the direction vector may have the correct slope, the parameterization doesn't lie on the given line. Hence, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check the math. y when x=17: (5/3)*17 is 85/3, which is about 28.333, and 17/3 is about 5.666. So, subtracting, 85/3 - 17/3 is 68/3 ≈22.666. Definitely not 5. So, yes, Option B is out.\n\nOption C: r(t) = [2, -7/3] + t[3/5, 1].\n\nFirst, check the point (2, -7/3). Plugging x=2 into the line equation: y = (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = -7/3. So, that's correct. The point is on the line. Now, the direction vector is [3/5, 1]. Let's compute the slope: rise over run is 1 divided by (3/5), which is 5/3. Perfect, that's the slope of our line. So, both the point is correct and the direction vector slope is correct. Therefore, Option C is valid.\n\nOption D: r(t) = [14/5, -1] + t[1, 3/5].\n\nFirst, check the point (14/5, -1). Let's compute y when x=14/5. So, y = (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3. Let's simplify: (5/3)*(14/5) = 14/3. Then, 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So, the point (14/5, -1) is indeed on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector [1, 3/5]. The slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, that's not 5/3. That's the reciprocal. So, 3/5 is not equal to 5/3. That means the direction vector's slope is wrong; it doesn't match the slope of the given line. Therefore, even though the point is correct, the direction vector is not appropriate. Hence, Option D is invalid.\n\nOption E: r(t) = [0, -17/3] + t[15, -25].\n\nFirst, check the point (0, -17/3). Plugging x=0 into the line equation gives y = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3. So, the point is correct.\n\nNow, the direction vector is [15, -25]. Let's find the slope: (-25)/15 simplifies to -5/3. Hmm, so the slope is -5/3, but the line has a slope of 5/3. The slope here is negative, which is opposite. So, the direction vector is not correct because the line's slope is positive 5/3, while this one is negative. Therefore, even though the point is correct, the direction vector is wrong. Thus, Option E is invalid.\n\nWait, let me verify the math again for Option E: direction vector [15, -25]. So, slope is -25/15 = -5/3. Yeah, that's correct. But the original line's slope is positive, so this is going in the opposite direction. So, it's still invalid. So, E is out.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nA: Point on line, direction vector slope correct. Valid.\n\nB: Point not on line. Invalid.\n\nC: Point on line, direction vector slope correct. Valid.\n\nD: Point on line, direction vector slope incorrect (wrong slope). Invalid.\n\nE: Point on line, direction vector slope incorrect (wrong slope). Invalid.\n\nHence, the valid options are A and C.\n\nWait, but hold on, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nOption A: Point (4,1). We checked, it's on the line. Direction vector slope 5/3. Correct.\n\nOption B: Point (17,5). y should be 68/3 ≈22.666, which is not 5. So, not on line. Disregard.\n\nOption C: Point (2, -7/3). We checked, yes. Direction vector [3/5,1]. Slope 5/3, correct.\n\nOption D: Point (14/5, -1). Correct on the line. Direction vector [1, 3/5]. Slope 3/5, which is not 5/3. So, wrong slope.\n\nOption E: Point (0, -17/3). Correct. Direction vector [15, -25]. Slope -5/3, not 5/3. So, wrong slope.\n\nHence, A and C are the only valid ones.\n\nWait, hold on. Is direction vector correct? Let me think about Option D: if direction vector is [1, 3/5], then moving one unit in x, you go up 3/5 in y. So, slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5, which is less than 1. So, it's flatter, which is not matching our original line's slope of 5/3 ≈1.666. So, definitely not the same.\n\nSimilarly, Option E has slope -5/3, which is going downwards instead of upwards. So, definitely wrong.\n\nOptions A and C have the correct slope, and both pass through a point on the line. So, they are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, hang on, just to make sure about Option E, sometimes parameterizations can still represent the line even if the direction vector is negative? Let me think. If we use a negative parameter t, does that flip the direction?\n\nBut, in general, parameterization is defined for all real numbers t, so the line is infinitely long in both directions. So, a parameterization that's going in the opposite direction is still valid because t can be any real number. However, in this case, the direction vector is negative. So, for our original line, which has a positive slope, direction vectors can be both positive or negative as long as they have the same direction ratio. Wait, hold on: in this case, the slope must be positive 5/3, so if the direction vector's slope is -5/3, that would be a line with a negative slope. So, regardless of t, you can't make that into a line with positive slope. Therefore, regardless of the t, the line would have a negative slope.\n\nBut, in our case, the original line is positive slope, so Option E's direction vector would give a line with negative slope, which is different. So, it's still a different line. Thus, E is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for Option D, even though it has the point correct, the slope is incorrect, so it's a different line.\n\nSo, yeah, in conclusion, only A and C are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given options are valid parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each parameterization: whether the point is on the line and whether the direction vector has the correct slope (5/3).\n\n1. **Option A**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n   - Check if (4, 1) is on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given options (A to E) are valid parameterizations for the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The missing condition was provided, which is that the line needs to be parameterized using vectors. Hmm, so essentially, I need to check each vector equation to see if it correctly represents the given line.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is usually given as r = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a point on the line and v is a direction vector for the line. So, I need to make sure that each option satisfies two conditions:\n1. The point given in r0 must lie on the line.\n2. The direction vector v must be parallel to the line, meaning the direction vector's slope should match the slope of the line.\n\nLet me recall that the slope of the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3 is 5/3. So, any valid parameterization should have a direction vector v such that the slope between its components is 5/3. In other words, for a direction vector (a, b), the slope should be b/a = 5/3.\n\nAlright, so first, I should calculate the slope of each direction vector in the options A to E and see if it's 5/3. Then, I'll check whether the given point in each parameterization lies on the line. If both conditions are satisfied, then that option is a valid parameterization.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nr = (4, 1) + t*(-3, -5)\n\nFirst, the direction vector is (-3, -5). Let's compute the slope: (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Perfect, that matches the slope of the line. Good so far.\n\nNow, check if the point (4, 1) lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nPlug x = 4 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\nSo, y = 1 when x = 4. That means the point (4,1) is indeed on the line.\n\nTherefore, Option A is valid.\n\n**Option B:**\nr = (17, 5) + t*(6, 10)\n\nDirection vector is (6,10). Slope is 10/6 = 5/3. That's good.\n\nCheck if (17, 5) is on the line.\n\nPlug x = 17 into the line equation:\ny = (5/3)*17 - 17/3 = (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\n\nBut the given point has y = 5, which is nowhere near 68/3. So, (17,5) is not on the line.\n\nTherefore, Option B is invalid because the point doesn't lie on the line, even though the direction vector is correct.\n\n**Option C:**\nr = (2, -7/3) + t*(3/5, 1)\n\nDirection vector is (3/5, 1). Let's compute the slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. Perfect.\n\nCheck if the point (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x = 2 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)*2 - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = (-7)/3. Which is equal to the y-coordinate given in the point. So, the point is on the line.\n\nTherefore, Option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\nr = (14/5, -1) + t*(1, 3/5)\n\nDirection vector is (1, 3/5). The slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Hmm, wait a second. The slope of the line is 5/3, but here we have 3/5, which is the reciprocal. So, that would mean the direction vector is not parallel to the given line. Hence, this is a problem.\n\nWait, actually, to clarify: If a direction vector has components (a, b), its slope is b/a. So, if we have (1, 3/5), slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. However, the slope of our line is 5/3, which is the negative reciprocal of 3/5. Wait, 3/5 is 0.6, and 5/3 is approximately 1.666... Not negative, but reciprocal in the sense that their product is 1.\n\nBut since 3/5 is not equal to 5/3, the direction vector is not parallel to the given line. So, even before checking the point, this parameterization is invalid because the direction is incorrect.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check the point as well. The point is (14/5, -1). Let's plug x = 14/5 into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - (17/3) = (-3)/3 = -1.\n\nSo, the point (14/5, -1) is indeed on the line. But since the direction vector is wrong, it's not a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option E:**\nr = (0, -17/3) + t*(15, -25)\n\nDirection vector is (15, -25). Let's compute the slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3. Hmm, that's negative, but the slope of our line is positive 5/3. So, is this a problem?\n\nWell, direction vectors can point in the opposite direction, but as long as they are scalar multiples, it's okay. However, the direction vector here has a slope of -5/3, which is negative, but our line has a positive slope. So, the direction vector is not parallel because the lines would not be the same unless they are overlapping.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. A direction vector with slope -5/3 is not a scalar multiple of a direction vector with slope 5/3 unless the scalar is negative. Let's see:\n\nIf we have a direction vector (15, -25), to check if it's a scalar multiple of (3,5) or (5/3,1). Let's see.\n\nSuppose (15, -25) = k*(3,5). Then, 15 = 3k and -25 = 5k. From 15=3k, k=5. Then, -25=5k=25. But -25 ≠ 25. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, trying k*(5/3,1):\n\n15 = (5/3)k => k = 15*(3/5)=9. Then, -25 should be 1*k=9. But -25≠9, so nope.\n\nSimilarly, if we take direction vector (1, 3/5):\n\n15 = 1*k => k=15\n\n-25 should be (3/5)*k=9, which is not.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5) or (5/3,1), hence the direction is not the same. So, it's not a valid direction vector for the line.\n\nBut let's just check the point (0, -17/3). Plugging x=0 into the line:\n\ny = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3, which matches.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these parameterizations are valid for the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay. Let me recall what a parameterization of a line is. It should be in the form of a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. \n\nSo, any valid parameterization must satisfy two things: first, the initial point (when t=0) should lie on the given line, and second, the direction vector should be parallel to the line, meaning it should have the same slope. \n\nLet me note down the given line: y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, the slope of this line is 5/3. Therefore, the direction vector of any valid parameterization must have a slope that's equal to 5/3 or a scalar multiple of that. \n\nAdditionally, the point through which the line passes (the initial point when t=0) must satisfy the equation of the line. That means if I plug the x and y values of the initial point into the line equation, it should hold true.\n\nSo, let's analyze each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (A):\n\n(A) The parameterization is [x; y] = [4; 1] + t[-3; -5].\n\nFirst, let's check the initial point (4,1). Plugging into the line equation: y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nCalculating y: (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. That works because the initial point is (4,1), which does satisfy the equation. So, the initial point is good.\n\nNext, check the direction vector [-3; -5]. To see if it's parallel to the line, we can compute the slope. The slope would be rise over run, which is -5 / (-3) = 5/3. That's the same as the slope of the given line, so the direction vector is valid.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\n(B) [x; y] = [17; 5] + t[6; 10].\n\nFirst, check the initial point (17,5). Plugging into the line equation: y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nCalculating y: (5/3)*17 -17/3 = 85/3 -17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.6667. But the initial y is 5, which is not equal to 68/3. Therefore, the initial point does not lie on the line. So, option (B) is invalid.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recalculate:\n\n(5/3)*17 = (85)/3 ≈ 28.3333. Then 85/3 -17/3 = (85-17)/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.6667. So, y = 22.6667, but the given point is (17,5). Since 5 ≠ 22.6667, the point is not on the line. So, yeah, invalid.\n\nSo, (B) is out.\n\nMoving on to option (C):\n\n(C) [x; y] = [2; -7/3] + t[3/5; 1].\n\nFirst, check the initial point (2, -7/3). Plug into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3.\n\nLeft side: y = -7/3.\n\nRight side: (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = -7/3. That's equal, so the initial point is on the line.\n\nNext, direction vector [3/5;1]. Let's find its slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. That's the same as the slope of the line, so it's valid. Therefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption (D):\n\n(D) [x; y] = [14/5; -1] + t[1; 3/5].\n\nCheck the initial point: x = 14/5 = 2.8, y = -1. Plug into the line equation:\n\ny should be (5/3)(14/5) -17/3. Let's compute (5/3)*(14/5) = 14/3. Then 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. That's equal to the initial y value, so the initial point is on the line.\n\nNext, direction vector [1; 3/5]. Slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, that's not the same as the line's slope of 5/3. So, the direction vector is not parallel. Therefore, option (D) is invalid because the direction vector is incorrect.\n\nWait, hold on: If the direction vector is [1; 3/5], its slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But the line has a slope of 5/3. These are reciprocals but not the same. So, they are not scalar multiples. Therefore, they are not parallel. So, (D) is invalid.\n\nOption (E):\n\n(E) [x; y] = [0; -17/3] + t[15; -25].\n\nFirst, check the initial point (0, -17/3). Plug into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3. So, at x=0, y should be -17/3, which matches the initial point. So, the initial point is good.\n\nNow, direction vector [15; -25]. Compute slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3. Hmm, the line's slope is 5/3. So, the direction vector has a slope of -5/3, which is the negative reciprocal of 5/3. Wait, but the negative reciprocal is -3/5, which is a different thing.\n\nWait, no. Wait: Slopes being negative reciprocals indicates perpendicularity. So, if the direction vector's slope is -5/3, which is negative reciprocal of 3/5, not 5/3. Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, actually, the direction vector is [15; -25]. So, slope is -25/15 = -5/3. The given line's slope is 5/3, so these are negative reciprocals. So, the direction vector is actually perpendicular to the given line.\n\nTherefore, since the direction vector is not parallel but rather perpendicular, this parameterization is invalid because it's not moving along the line, but along a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of direction vector as a vector, not just the slope, perhaps the direction vector [15; -25] must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the line.\n\nWhat's the direction vector of the line? For a line with slope 5/3, a direction vector can be [3;5] because moving 3 in x and 5 in y keeps the slope 5/3.\n\nAlternatively, any scalar multiple of that, like [6;10], [9;15], etc., or negatives like [-3;-5], [-6;-10], etc. \n\nBut option (E)'s direction vector is [15; -25]. Let's see if this is a scalar multiple of [3;5]. Let's check if 15/3 = 5/1. So, 15 divided by 3 is 5, and -25 divided by 5 is -5. So, 15/3 =5, but -25/5=-5. These are not equal, so [15; -25] is not a scalar multiple of [3;5]. Therefore, the direction vector is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, we can see if [15; -25] is parallel by cross product. For two vectors to be parallel, their components must satisfy (v1*w2 = v2*w1). Let's see, vector of the line is [3;5], direction vector is [15; -25]. \n\nSo, 3*(-25) = -75, and 5*15=75. -75 ≠ 75. Therefore, they are not parallel. So, direction vector is not correct, which makes (E) invalid.\n\nTherefore, only options (A) and (C) are valid.\n\nWait, just double-checking to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor option (E), maybe the direction vector could have a different scaling. Let me check: Is [15; -25] a scalar multiple of [3;5]? Let's find scalar k such that 15 = k*3 and -25 = k*5. \n\n15=3k implies k=5. Then, -25=5k implies k=-5. Contradiction, so no, it's not a scalar multiple. So, definitely not parallel.\n\nOkay, so the conclusion is only (A) and (C) are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C), so the answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: if the initial point lies on the line and if the direction vector is parallel to the line (i.e., has the same slope).\n\n1. **Option (A)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (4, 1) \\) lies on the line: \n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot 4 - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = 1\n     \\]\n     The point satisfies the line equation.\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope of direction vector: \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which matches the line's slope.\n   - Therefore, option (A) is valid.\n\n2. **Option (B)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (17, 5) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (17, 5) \\) lies on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot 17 - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\neq 5\n     \\]\n     The point does not satisfy the line equation.\n   - Therefore, option (B) is invalid.\n\n3. **Option (C)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (2, -\\frac{7}{3}) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (2, -\\frac{7}{3}) \\) lies on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot 2 - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}\n     \\]\n     The point satisfies the line equation.\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope of direction vector: \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which matches the line's slope.\n   - Therefore, option (C) is valid.\n\n4. **Option (D)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( \\left( \\frac{14}{5}, -1 \\right) \\)\n   - Check if \\( \\left( \\frac{14}{5}, -1 \\right) \\) lies on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{14}{5} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -1\n     \\]\n     The point satisfies the line equation.\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\frac{3}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope of direction vector: \\( \\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\), which does not match the line's slope.\n   - Therefore, option (D) is invalid.\n\n5. **Option (E)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\) lies on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot 0 - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3}\n     \\]\n     The point satisfies the line equation.\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope of direction vector: \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\), which does not match the line's slope.\n   - Therefore, option (E) is invalid.\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A,C}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. There are five options labeled (A) through (E), and I need to check each one to see if it's a valid parameterization.\n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a specific point on the line (the point when \\(t = 0\\)) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector of the line.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to check two things:\n1. Does the given point \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) lie on the line?\n2. Is the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the original line?\n\nThe original line is given by y = (5/3)x - 17/3. To find its direction vector, I can look at the coefficients of x and y. Since it's in slope-intercept form, the slope is 5/3. Direction vectors are usually written in the form \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\), where \\(b/a\\) equals the slope of the line.\n\nSo, for the original line, if we take a = 3, then b should be 5, giving a slope of 5/3. Therefore, a direction vector for this line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). However, any scalar multiple of this vector is also a valid direction vector, so vectors like \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), etc., are all acceptable as direction vectors.\n\nNow, I need to check each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if the point (4,1) lies on the line. Plugging x=4 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So yes, (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Let's see if this is a scalar multiple of \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). If we multiply the original direction vector by -1, we get \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), so it's a valid direction vector.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (17,5) is on the line. Plugging x=17 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3 = 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.6667. However, the y-value given is 5, which is much less than 68/3. So (17,5) is not on the line.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is not a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if the point (2, -7/3) is on the line. Plugging x=2:\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = -7/3. So yes, that point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The original direction vector should be a multiple of \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Let's see if \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a multiple.\n\nSuppose there is a scalar k such that:\n3/5 = k * 3\n1 = k * 5\n\nFrom the first equation: k = (3/5) / 3 = 1/5\nFrom the second equation: k = 1 / 5\n\nThey both give k = 1/5, so yes, \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a valid direction vector.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line. Let's compute y:\ny = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So yes, (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The direction vector given is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). We need to see if this is a multiple of the original direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nLet’s suppose there's a scalar k such that:\n1 = k * 3\n3/5 = k * 5\n\nFrom the first equation: k = 1/3\nFrom the second equation: k = (3/5)/5 = 3/25\n\nSince k is not the same in both equations (1/3 ≈ 0.333 vs 3/25 = 0.12), this direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the original direction vector.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is not a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line. Plugging x=0:\ny = (5/3)(0) - 17/3 = -17/3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. The direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Let's see if this is a multiple of the original direction vector.\n\nThe original direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Let's check if there's a scalar k such that:\n15 = k * 3\n-25 = k * 5\n\nFrom the first equation: k = 15 / 3 = 5\nFrom the second equation: k = -25 / 5 = -5\n\nSince k is 5 in the first equation and -5 in the second, they are not equal. Therefore, the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is not a scalar multiple of \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). So this direction vector is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is not a valid parameterization.\n\nSo, after checking all options, only (A) and (C) are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C). Therefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n\n\\\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: whether the given point lies on the line and whether the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the original line.\n\n1. **Option (A):**\n   - Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check if it lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options (A) through (E) are valid parameterizations of the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, parameterizing a line usually involves finding a point on the line and a direction vector, right?\n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{p} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) is a specific point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a direction vector that's parallel to the line. So, I need to check each option to see if both the point \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) lies on the given line and if the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a scalar multiple of the slope vector of the line.\n\nThe slope of the given line is 5/3. So, a direction vector should have a slope of 5/3, meaning that for some scalar a, the direction vector can be written as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ (5/3)a \\end{pmatrix} \\). Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by the same number to eliminate fractions can make it easier, like \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) or any scalar multiple of that.\n\nSo, first, for each option, I should:\n\n1. Check if the given point \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n2. Verify that the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3,5) or equivalent.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if (4,1) lies on the line. Plug x=4 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. Perfect, that works.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (-3, -5). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Well, (-3, -5) is just -1*(3,5), so yes, it's a scalar multiple. So, the direction is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if (17,5) lies on the line. Plug x=17 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3 = (85/3 - 17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666..., but the y-coordinate given is 5. 5 is 15/3, which is much less. So, clearly, (17,5) is not on the line. So, Option B is invalid.\n\nBut just for thoroughness, let's check the direction vector: (6,10). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Yes, because 6 = 2*3 and 10 = 2*5, so it's 2*(3,5). So the direction is correct, but the point isn't on the line, so it's invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line. Let's compute y when x=2:\n\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = (-7)/3, which is equal to -7/3. So, the point is correct.\n\nNow, the direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's check if this is a scalar multiple of (3,5). Let's see, does (3/5, 1) = k*(3,5) for some scalar k?\n\nSo, if 3/5 = 3k, then k = (3/5)/3 = 1/5. Then, checking the second component: 5k = 5*(1/5) = 1. So yes, the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3,5). Specifically, 1/5*(3,5) = (3/5,1).\n\nTherefore, Option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line. Let's compute y when x=14/5:\n\ny = (5/3)*(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - (17/3) = (-3)/3 = -1. So, the point is correct.\n\nNow, direction vector is (1, 3/5). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see if 1/3 = (3/5)/5?\n\nWait, let me think. We can see if (1, 3/5) can be written as k*(3,5). So:\n\n1 = 3k ⇒ k = 1/3.\n\nThen, 3/5 = 5k ⇒ 5k = 3/5 ⇒ k = 3/25.\n\nBut 1/3 ≠ 3/25, which means that the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). So, the direction is wrong.\n\nWait, let's see another way. Maybe (1, 3/5) can be written as something else?\n\nThe direction vector (1, 3/5) has a slope of (3/5)/1 = 3/5. The given line has slope 5/3. So, unless 3/5 is equal to 5/3, which it's not (their reciprocals), they're different.\n\nSo, the direction vector is not parallel to the given line. So, Option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line. Plug in x=0:\n\ny = (5/3)(0) - 17/3 = -17/3. Correct, so the point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is (15, -25). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see. Let's check if 15/3 = -25/5. 15/3 = 5 and -25/5 = -5. 5 ≠ -5, so it's not the same scalar multiple. Alternatively, could it be a scalar multiple where direction is reversed?\n\nBut scaling (3,5) by a negative scalar would give direction vector (-3k, -5k). So, if 15 = -3k, then k = -5, then direction vector would be (15, -25), but wait: Wait, no, if (3,5) scaled by -5 would be (-15, -25). But given direction vector is (15, -25), so that's scalar multiple of (15, -25) = 5*(3, -5). Wait, but the original slope is 5/3, direction vector should have slope 5/3.\n\nWait, let's compute the slope of the direction vector in Option E. The direction vector is (15, -25). So, the slope would be (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is negative. But the given line has a slope of 5/3, which is positive. So, the direction vector in Option E has a slope of -5/3, which is the negative of the required slope.\n\nHence, the direction is incorrect. It's pointing in the opposite direction but with the wrong magnitude.\n\nTherefore, Option E is invalid.\n\nWait a second, just to verify, can (15, -25) be written as a scalar multiple of (3,5)?\n\nLet's solve for k: 15 = 3k ⇒ k=5. Then, -25 should equal 5k ⇒ 5*5 =25, but it's -25, so nope. So, it's not a scalar multiple, as previously thought.\n\nTherefore, direction is incorrect.\n\nSo, recapitulating:\n\nOptions A: Valid\n\nB: Invalid (point not on the line)\n\nC: Valid\n\nD: Invalid (wrong direction vector)\n\nE: Invalid (wrong direction vector; negative slope)\n\nThus, the valid ones are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C. So, the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n\nBut hold on, according to the instructions, I should put all correct options inside a single box, separated by commas. So, the final answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) are valid, we need to check two things for each option: \n1.

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\). There are five options, labeled (A) through (E), each providing a vector equation. I need to check each one to see if it accurately represents the given line.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a parameterization of a line in vector form is typically written as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{v} \\), where \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) is a point on the line and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is a direction vector. The direction vector should be parallel to the line, which in this case has a slope of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). That means the direction vector should have components that reflect this slope.\n\nSo, for a direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} \\), the slope \\( m \\) is given by \\( m = \\frac{v_y}{v_x} \\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \\frac{5}{3} \\). This implies that \\( v_y = \\frac{5}{3}v_x \\). So, for each option, I can check if their direction vectors satisfy this relationship.\n\nAdditionally, each parameterization must satisfy the given line equation when I plug in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from the parameterization. That is, for any parameter \\( t \\), \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) should hold true.\n\nLet me start by examining each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, let's check the direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope here is \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which matches the slope of the given line. Good.\n\nNow, let's plug in the point \\( (4, 1) \\) into the line equation to see if it satisfies:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = 1 \\), which matches the point \\( (4, 1) \\). Therefore, this parameterization is valid. So, option (A) is correct.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope is \\( \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which is correct.\n\nNow, plug in the point \\( (17, 5) \\) into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} \\)\n\nCalculate \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\times 17 = \\frac{85}{3} \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.6667 \\)\n\nBut the y-coordinate given is 5, which is not equal to \\( \\frac{68}{3} \\). Therefore, the point \\( (17, 5) \\) does not lie on the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\). So, this parameterization is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. But let me double-check in case I made a miscalculation.\n\nCalculating \\( y \\) when \\( x = 17 \\):\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.6667 \\)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the point \\( (17,5) \\) is not on the line. Therefore, this parameterization is invalid. So, option (B) is incorrect.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope is \\( \\frac{1}{3/5} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which matches the line's slope. Good.\n\nNow, check the point \\( (2, -7/3) \\):\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 2 \\) into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\)\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate given. So, the point lies on the line.\n\nNow, let's check if the direction vector is correct. The slope from the direction vector is \\( 1 / (3/5) = 5/3 \\), which is correct. So, yes, this parameterization is valid. Therefore, option (C) is correct.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope here is \\( \\frac{3/5}{1} = 3/5 \\). Wait, but the slope of the line is \\( 5/3 \\), so the direction vector's slope is \\( 3/5 \\), which is the reciprocal and flipped.\n\nThis would mean that the direction vector is perpendicular to the line, not parallel to it. Therefore, the direction vector is incorrect. So, option (D) is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check: the direction vector given is \\( (1, 3/5) \\), so the slope is \\( (3/5)/1 = 3/5 \\). But the line has a slope of \\( 5/3 \\), which is a reciprocal, meaning they are perpendicular. So, the direction vector is not along the line, so it's invalid. So, option (D) is incorrect.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope is \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\). Hmm, this is a slope of \\( -5/3 \\), which is negative, whereas our line has a positive slope \\( 5/3 \\). So, the direction vector is pointing in the opposite direction, but direction vectors can technically be in either direction. However, the slope must match the slope of the line, so even if it's negative, it's not the same.\n\nMoreover, even if we factor in the negative, the slope would be \\( 5/3 \\) if we take the absolute value, but in reality, since direction vectors can be scaled, maybe the sign isn't a problem? Wait, no. The direction vector's slope should exactly match the line's slope. So, here, slope is \\( -5/3 \\), which does not equal \\( 5/3 \\). Therefore, the direction vector is incorrect.\n\nTo verify, let's compute the slope again: \\( -25 / 15 = -5/3 \\). Definitely, not matching \\( 5/3 \\). So, direction vector is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, let's check the starting point. The point is \\( (0, -17/3) \\). Plug into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -17/3 \\). So, the point \\( (0, -17/3) \\) is on the line. So, the starting point is correct.\n\nBut since the direction vector is incorrect (slope is opposite), the entire parameterization is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if we take \\( t \\) as a scalar, perhaps by taking negative \\( t \\), but direction vectors inherently define a line with a specific direction, so slopes must match exactly. Therefore, slope does not match, so option (E) is incorrect.\n\nSo, going back to all the options:\n\n(A) Valid.\n\n(B) Invalid.\n\n(C) Valid.\n\n(D) Invalid.\n\n(E) Invalid.\n\nHence, the valid parameterizations are (A) and (C).\n\nWait, hold on—I need to ensure I didn't make a mistake in checking (E). The direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Maybe they simplified the vector or something? Let me double-check.\n\n15 and -25 share a common factor of 5. So, we can write the direction vector as \\( 5 \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). But that vector has a slope of \\( (-5)/3 = -5/3 \\), which is still not equal to 5/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we factor in the negative, is \\( -5/3 \\) equivalent in any way? But no, the slope is negative, so it's not the same as 5/3.\n\nAlso, let me check the equation again: \\( y = 5/3 x - 17/3 \\). So, slope is positive, so direction vector should have a positive slope.\n\nIf direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\), then:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\), which is negative. Therefore, no, it's not parallel to the line.\n\nTherefore, (E) is incorrect.\n\nHence, only options (A) and (C) are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nSo, the final answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n\nBut, looking back at the problem, it says \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, in the format: \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}. But usually, multiple answers are given inside one box, separated by commas.\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n\nBut sometimes, in certain conventions, it might need to be inside a single box without specifying, but to make it clear, perhaps.\n\nBut looking at how the question was phrased: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, likely, write as \\boxed{A,C}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: if the direction vector has the correct slope and if the given point lies on the line.\n\n1. **Option (A)**:\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope: \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) (correct)\n   - Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check: \\( 1 = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\) (correct)\n   - Conclusion: Valid\n\n2. **Option (B)**:\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope: \\( \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) (correct)\n   - Point: \\( (17, 5) \\)\n   - Check: \\( 5 = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\) (incorrect)\n   - Conclusion: Invalid\n\n3. **Option (C)**:\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope: \\( \\frac{1}{3/5} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) (correct)\n   - Point: \\( (2, -7/3) \\)\n   - Check: \\( -\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) (correct)\n   - Conclusion: Valid\n\n4. **Option (D)**:\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope: \\( \\frac{3/5}{1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\) (incorrect, as it is the reciprocal)\n   - Conclusion: Invalid\n\n5. **Option (E)**:\n   - Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Slope: \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\) (incorrect, as it is negative)\n   - Conclusion: Invalid\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n\\]",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which parameterizations of a line are valid. The line given is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. There are five options, labeled (A) through (E), each with a different parameterization using vectors. My job is to determine which of these are correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is usually written as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a point on the line, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a direction vector that's parallel to the line. So, for each option, I need to check two things: does the point \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) lie on the given line, and is the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the original line?\n\nLet me first figure out the direction vector of the given line. The equation is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. In slope-intercept form, that's y = mx + b, where m is the slope, which is 5/3. So, the direction vector should have a slope of 5/3. That means a direction vector can be represented as something like (3,5), because 5/3 is the rise over run.\n\nBut actually, the direction vector doesn't have to be (3,5); any scalar multiple of that vector would also be valid. For example, (6,10) is just 2*(3,5), which is a multiple, so that's also a valid direction vector. So I need to check for each option if their direction vector is a multiple of (3,5), or (3,5) scaled by some factor.\n\nAdditionally, for each parameterization, I need to check if the initial point \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) satisfies the equation of the line. That means plugging the x and y values from the point into the equation y = (5/3)x -17/3 and seeing if both sides are equal.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (A):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if the point (4,1) lies on the line. Plugging x = 4 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*4 -17/3 = 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So yes, y = 1, which matches the point (4,1). Good.\n\nNow, check the direction vector (-3, -5). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Yes, because if you multiply (3,5) by -1, you get (-3, -5). So the direction vector is valid.\n\nSo option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if (17,5) is on the line. Plug x =17 into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*17 -17/3 = (85/3) -17/3 = 68/3 ≈22.666, but the given y is 5, which is not equal to 68/3. So the point (17,5) does not lie on the line. Therefore, option (B) is invalid.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Maybe I did the math wrong.\n\nWait, (5/3)*17 is 85/3, right? Then subtracting 17/3, that's 85/3 -17/3 = 68/3, which is approximately 22.666. So y should be 68/3, but in the parameterization, it's given as 5, which is 15/3. So 15/3 vs 68/3 is not equal. So yeah, (17,5) is not on the line. So option (B) is invalid.\n\nSo moving on to option (C):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if the point (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x =2 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3. Which is exactly the y given. So the point (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector. The direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's see if this is a scalar multiple of (3,5). Let me call the direction vector as (a,b) = (3/5,1) and the original direction vector is (3,5).\n\nIf (a,b) = k*(3,5), then:\n\n3/5 = 3k => k = 1/5\n\nand 1 = 5k => k = 1/5\n\nSo, both components agree that k =1/5. Therefore, (3/5,1) is indeed a scalar multiple of (3,5). Thus, the direction vector is valid.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\nNext, option (D):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line. Let's compute y when x=14/5.\n\nCompute y = (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3. Simplify:\n\n(5/3)*(14/5) = 14/3\n\nThen subtract 17/3: 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1.\n\nSo, y = -1, which matches the given point. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector (1, 3/5). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)?\n\nLet's see:\n\nLet k be the scalar such that (1, 3/5) = k*(3,5). Then,\n\n1 = 3k => k =1/3\n\n3/5 = 5k => k = 3/(5*5) = 3/25? Wait, that's not consistent.\n\nWait, wait, no:\n\nFrom the first component, k =1/3.\n\nSo, the second component would be 5k =5*(1/3)=5/3.\n\nBut the second component is 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3.\n\nSo (1, 3/5) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). So the direction vector is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the slope of the direction vector. The slope from (1,3/5) would be (3/5)/1 =3/5. However, the original line has a slope of 5/3, which is the reciprocal and different.\n\nWait, actually, if the direction vector is (1, 3/5), then the slope is (3/5)/1 =3/5, which is not equal to the slope of the given line (5/3). So, this direction vector is not parallel to the original line.\n\nTherefore, the parameterization in option (D) is invalid because the direction vector is not correct.\n\nWait, maybe another way: if the direction vector's slope isn't equal to the line's slope, it's invalid. So, since 3/5 ≠5/3, it's invalid. So, yes, option (D) is invalid.\n\nMoving on to option (E):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, check if the point (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=0 into the equation: y = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3. Which is exactly the y given. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector (15, -25). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)?\n\nLet me see: If (15, -25) = k*(3,5), then:\n\n15 = 3k => k=5\n\n-25 =5k =>k= -5\n\nBut k cannot be both 5 and -5 at the same time, so this is inconsistent. Therefore, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). Alternatively, maybe compute if they are scalar multiples:\n\nIs 15/(-25) = 3/5? Let's see: 15/-25 = -3/5, which is the negative reciprocal of 5/3. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, the direction vector (15, -25) has a slope of (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nBut the original line has a slope of 5/3. So, the direction vector's slope is -5/3, which is the negative of 5/3.\n\nThat means that the direction vector is pointing in the opposite direction, but still parallel because parallel lines have the same or opposite slope.\n\nWait, no, in vectors, direction vectors can point in either direction along the line, so as long as it's a scalar multiple, including negative scalars, then it's still a valid direction vector.\n\nWait, so is (-25)/15 a multiple of 5/3? Or, rather, is the direction vector a multiple?\n\nWait, actually, let me compute whether (15, -25) is a scalar multiple of (3,5). So, (15, -25) can be written as 5*(3, -5). But (3, -5) is not a multiple of (3,5). Alternatively, is (15, -25) = k*(3,5)?\n\nSo, 15 = 3k =>k=5\n\nBut then -25 =5k =>k= -5\n\nWhich is inconsistent, so no, (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). So that means the direction vector is not along the line.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The direction vector is (15, -25). If I write that as 5*(3, -5), then perhaps.\n\nBut (3, -5) is not parallel to (3,5). The slope of (3, -5) is -5/3, which is the negative reciprocal of 5/3, which would be the slope of a perpendicular line.\n\nWait, so (15, -25) is not just any scalar multiple of (3,5); in fact, it's a scalar multiple but in a different direction.\n\nWait, but regardless, parallel lines can have direction vectors that are in opposite directions. So, actually, wait, perhaps (15, -25) is a scalar multiple?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf (15, -25) = k*(3,5), then 15 =3k and -25=5k. So k must be 5 and -5, which is a contradiction. So, no, it's not a scalar multiple.\n\nAlternatively, if you consider the direction vector (15, -25), which can be simplified by dividing by 5: (3, -5). The direction vector (3,-5) has a slope of (-5)/3 = -5/3, which is the negative reciprocal of 5/3. So it's a perpendicular vector, not parallel.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is not parallel to the original line, which has a slope of 5/3. Thus, the direction vector in option (E) is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, hold on, the direction vector is (15, -25), which has a slope of (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is different from 5/3. So the direction is actually opposite in slope, meaning it's perpendicular, so definitely not parallel.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, unless there's a scaling factor that can make them parallel? But we saw that with k=5 and k=-5, it's inconsistent, so no, no scalar multiple can make them equal.\n\nSo, conclusion: only options (A) and (C) are valid.\n\nWait, wait, let me recapitulate:\n\nFor (A): point is on the line, direction vector is a scalar multiple of original direction vector. Valid.\n\nFor (B): point is not on the line. Invalid.\n\nFor (C): point is on the line, direction vector is a multiple of original. Valid.\n\nFor (D): point is on the line, but direction vector not a multiple. Invalid.\n\nFor (E): point is on the line, direction vector not a multiple. Invalid.\n\nSo, only (A) and (C) are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nWait, but according to the system's instruction, I should enter the letters separated by commas inside a single box. So, I should write:\n\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n\nBut no, in the example, it was a single box with letters. Wait, looking back at the user's instruction: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, inside one box, separated by commas.\n\nSo, it should be \\boxed{A,C}\n\nYes, I think that's the correct way.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) are valid, we need to check two things for each option: if the initial point lies on the line and if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector (which is \\( (3, 5) \\) or any scalar multiple of it).\n\n1. **Option (A)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (4, 1) \\) lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

Invalid.\n   - Direction vector: \\( (6, 10) \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( (3, 5) \\). However, the initial point is invalid. Invalid.\n\n3. **Option (C)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (2, -\\frac{7}{3}) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (2, -\\frac{7}{3}) \\) lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\). Valid.\n   - Direction vector: \\( (\\frac{3}{5}, 1) \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( (3, 5) \\) (specifically, \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times (3, 5) \\)). Valid.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n4. **Option (D)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (\\frac{14}{5}, -1) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (\\frac{14}{5}, -1) \\) lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(\\frac{14}{5}) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -1 \\). Valid.\n   - Direction vector: \\( (1, \\frac{3}{5}) \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( (3, 5) \\). Invalid.\n   - Conclusion: Invalid.\n\n5. **Option (E)**:\n   - Initial point: \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\)\n   - Check if \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\) lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3} \\). Valid.\n   - Direction vector: \\( (15, -25) \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( (3, 5) \\).

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations of the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3 are valid. The options are labeled from A to E, and each one is a vector equation. I remember that a parameterization of a line should have a point on the line as the initial point (the constant vector) and a direction vector that's parallel to the line. \n\nFirst, let me recall that the given line is in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b. Here, m is 5/3, which is the slope, and b is -17/3, which is the y-intercept. So, any valid parameterization must have a direction vector that is a scalar multiple of the slope. The slope of the line is 5/3, so the direction vector should have a rise over run of 5/3. \n\nAlso, the parameterization should pass through a specific point on the line. That means when t = 0, the point (x, y) should satisfy y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, for each option, I'll check two things: \n\n1. Whether the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (5/3, 1) or (5, 3), which is another common representation since slope is rise/run. \n\n2. Whether the point given when t = 0 lies on the original line.\n\nAlright, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's check the direction vector: (-3, -5). I can see that this vector is a scalar multiple of (3, 5), which is indeed a multiple of (5, 3) scaled by 3/5. Since slope is 5/3, and this direction vector has a slope of -5/-3 = 5/3, which is correct. So, direction is fine.\n\nNext, check the point when t = 0: (4, 1). Let's plug this into the original equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x - 17/3\n\nLeft side: y = 1\n\nRight side: (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = (20/3) - (17/3) = 3/3 = 1\n\nSo, yes, (4, 1) is on the line. Therefore, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, the direction vector is (6, 10). Let's see if this is a scalar multiple of (5, 3). \n\nSo, if we have (6, 10) = k*(5, 3). Let's solve for k.\n\nFrom x-component: 6 = 5k => k = 6/5.\n\nFrom y-component: 10 = 3k => k = 10/3.\n\nBut 6/5 is not equal to 10/3. Therefore, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of (5, 3). Thus, the direction is incorrect. The slope would be 10/6 = 5/3, which is the same as the given line, but direction vectors should be scalar multiples, not just have the same slope. Hmm, wait a second. \n\nWait, actually, if the direction vector is (6,10), the slope is 10/6 = 5/3, which matches the slope of the line. So, it's directionally correct, but it's not a scalar multiple. Because 5/3 should be the same as 10/6, but actually, both reduce to 5/3. Hmm, is this acceptable?\n\nWait, so maybe the direction vector doesn't have to be exactly (5, 3), just any scalar multiple, which (6,10) is (1.2*(5,3))? Let's see:\n\nIs 6 = 1.2*5? 1.2*5 is 6, yes. Is 10 = 1.2*3? 1.2*3 is 3.6, not 10. So, that doesn't hold. So, 6 is 6/5 times 5, but 10 is 10/3 times 3.\n\nWait, so they aren't consistent. Therefore, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of (5, 3), but actually, does it matter?\n\nWait, because if you have a direction vector, any scalar multiple will give the same line. So, even though (6,10) isn't a multiple of (5,3), the slope is still 5/3. So, could it be still a valid parameterization?\n\nWait, but in that case, we can have infinitely many parameterizations with different direction vectors as long as they have the same slope. Hmm, so maybe direction vectors as long as they have the correct slope would be acceptable?\n\nWait, but I think in terms of vectors, a direction vector has to be specifically a multiple of the direction of the line, but because direction is about slope, any vector that is a scalar multiple is acceptable.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the direction vector must be parallel to the line. So, in the case of a parameterization, the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the line. So, if the slope of the line is 5/3, the direction vector must be (3,5), or any multiple thereof. But in this case, (6,10) is 2*(3,5), right? Wait: (6,10) = 2*(3,5). So, actually, it is a scalar multiple. Because 6 = 2*3, and 10 = 2*5.\n\nWait, hold on. 3*2 is 6, 5*2 is 10. So, yes, direction vector (6,10) is 2*(3,5), which is a multiple of the direction vector (3,5). So, in that sense, Option B's direction vector is correct because it's a scalar multiple.\n\nThen, let's check the point when t=0: (17,5). Is this on the original line?\n\nPlug into y = (5/3)x -17/3:\n\nLeft side: y =5\n\nRight side: (5/3)*17 -17/3 = (85/3) -17/3 = (68/3) ≈22.666\n\nBut 5 ≠ 22.666, so (17,5) is not on the line. Therefore, even though the direction vector is correct, the point is not on the line. So, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Hmm. So my confusion comes from whether the direction vector has to be a multiple of (5,3). So, the line y= (5/3)x -17/3. The slope is 5/3, so the direction vector is any scalar multiple of (3,5) or (5,3) if we think in terms of rise over run. So, (3,5) would go 3 in x and 5 in y, which gives a slope of 5/3.\n\nTherefore, (6,10) is 2*(3,5), which is a direction vector with slope 5/3, so correct. However, the point (17,5): let's check whether it is on the line. So, y =5, and (5/3)*17 -17/3= (85/3 -17/3)= 68/3≈22.666. But 22.666≠5, so no. Therefore, point is not on the line.\n\nThus, since the initial point is not on the line, even though the direction vector is correct, the parameterization is invalid because it doesn't start at a point on the line. So, Option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's look at the direction vector: (3/5, 1). What's the slope here? It's (1)/(3/5) = 5/3, which is correct. So, direction is correct.\n\nNext, check the initial point: (2, -7/3). Let's plug into the original equation:\n\ny = (5/3)x -17/3\n\nLeft side: y = -7/3\n\nRight side: (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3\n\nYes, they are equal. So, the point is on the line. Therefore, Option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, direction vector is (1, 3/5). Let's compute the slope here: (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But the slope of the original line is 5/3. So, 3/5 is the reciprocal of 5/3. So, they are negative reciprocals? Wait, 3/5 is not the reciprocal; the reciprocal of 5/3 is 3/5. Wait, no, 5/3 is approximately 1.666, 3/5 is 0.6. Not negative reciprocals, since it's positive. Wait, so 3/5 is not the negative reciprocal.\n\nWait, so if we have a direction vector with slope 3/5, which is different from 5/3, it's not parallel. So, that would mean the line of parameterization would have a different slope, which would not be the same as the original line. Therefore, even if the initial point is on the line, the direction is wrong. So, the slope of the direction vector is 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3. Therefore, the direction is incorrect, and this is not a valid parameterization. \n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let's check the initial point as well.\n\nInitial point: (14/5, -1). Let's check if it's on the original line.\n\nCompute y: (5/3)(14/5) -17/3 = (14/3) -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1\n\nYes, that's correct. So, point is on the line, but direction vector is wrong. Therefore, invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's check the direction vector: (15, -25). The slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3. Hmm, that's the negative of the original slope. So, if the original slope is 5/3, this direction vector has slope -5/3, which is different. Therefore, the direction is not correct; it's not parallel to the original line. So, that would make it an invalid parameterization, regardless of the initial point.\n\nBut let's check the initial point: (0, -17/3). Is that on the original line?\n\nYes, because when x=0, y= -17/3, which is exactly the y-intercept. So, point is on the line, but the direction is wrong. So, it's invalid because it's not parallel.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Option A: Correct initial point, correct direction vector. Valid.\n\n- Option B: Incorrect initial point, although correct direction vector. Invalid.\n\n- Option C: Correct initial point, correct direction vector. Valid.\n\n- Option D: Correct initial point, but incorrect direction vector. Invalid.\n\n- Option E: Incorrect direction vector, correct initial point. Invalid.\n\nThus, the valid options are A and C.\n\n**Wait a moment**, in Option D, I just noticed that the direction vector is (1, 3/5). So, this is a rise over run of 3/5, meaning for every 1 unit right, it goes up 3/5. But the original line is steeper, with slope 5/3, so each 3 units right, it goes up 5. So, actually, Option D's direction vector is going up more slowly than needed. Hence, not parallel.\n\nBut now, thinking about Option C's direction vector: (3/5, 1). So, in this case, for every 3/5 units right, it goes up 1. Which is 1 divided by 3/5, so slope of 1/(3/5) = 5/3, which is correct.\n\nYes, so Option C's direction vector is (3/5, 1), which has slope 5/3, correct.\n\nSo, confirming, Option C is okay. So, I think my conclusion is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C, so the answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) are valid, we need to check two conditions for each option: \n1.

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations are valid for the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The options are A through E, each with a different vector equation. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a parameterization of a line typically looks like r = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a point on the line (the initial point) and v is the direction vector of the line. So, to check if each option is valid, I need to verify two things: \n\n1. Does the given initial point lie on the line?\n2. Does the direction vector correspond to the slope of the line?\n\nThe line given has the equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, the slope is 5/3, which is the same as the direction vector (dx, dy) must satisfy dy/dx = 5/3. That means that for every increase of 3 in x, y increases by 5, so the direction vector can be any scalar multiple of (3,5).\n\nAlternatively, direction vectors can also be written as (3k, 5k) where k is any non-zero scalar. For simplicity, k could be 1, -1, etc., so direction vectors like (3,5), (-3,-5), (6,10), (-6,-10), etc., all satisfy the slope condition.\n\nSo, for each option, I will first check the initial point (the constant vector) to see if it satisfies the line equation. Then, I'll check if the direction vector has a slope of 5/3 or is a scalar multiple of it.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nr = [4, 1] + t[-3, -5]\nFirst, check the initial point (4,1).\nPlug x=4 into the line equation: y = (5/3)*4 -17/3 = 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 =1. So, yes, (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is [-3, -5]. Let's see the slope: (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which is correct. But wait, usually, a direction vector's slope can be positive or negative, as long as it's a scalar multiple. Here, [-3,-5] is the same as multiplying (3,5) by -1, so slope remains positive 5/3. So the direction vector is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\nr = [17,5] + t[6,10]\nCheck the initial point (17,5).\nPlug x=17 into the line: y = (5/3)*17 -17/3 = (85/3 -17/3) = 68/3 ≈22.666..., but the given y is 5, which is not 68/3 (≈22.666). So the initial point is not on the line.\n\nSince the initial point isn't on the line, even if the direction vector were correct, it wouldn't parameterize the line. But let me just check the direction vector's slope.\n\nDirection vector [6,10]: slope is 10/6 = 5/3. That's correct slope. But since the initial point isn't on the line, this is not a valid parameterization.\n\nSo, Option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\nr = [2, -7/3] + t[3/5, 1]\nFirst, check the initial point (2, -7/3).\nPlug x=2 into the line: y=(5/3)*2 -17/3 =10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3. So, y=-7/3, which matches. So, initial point is good.\n\nNow, direction vector [3/5,1]. Let's compute the slope: (1)/(3/5) = 5/3. Which is correct. But wait, direction vector components are fractions; slope is correct.\n\nSo, this seems good. Let me just verify:\n\nIf I take the direction vector [3/5,1], it can be written as (3/5,1) = (3,5)*(1/5). So, it's a scalar multiple of (3,5). Therefore, the slope is 5/3, as desired.\n\nSo, the direction vector is correct, and the initial point is on the line. So, Option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\nr = [14/5, -1] + t[1, 3/5]\nCheck initial point (14/5, -1). Let me see if it's on the line.\n\nCompute y when x=14/5: y = (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3 = (14/3) -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. So, y=-1. Perfect, so initial point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is [1, 3/5]. Compute the slope: (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But the line's slope is 5/3, which is not 3/5. So, that's incorrect. Alternatively, if the direction vector is [1, 3/5], the slope is 3/5, which is reciprocal but not the same as 5/3. Wait, 3/5 vs. 5/3 – they are negative reciprocals, but only if multiplied to get -1.\n\nBut in reality, the direction vector should be in the direction of (3,5), so any multiple. Here, 1 over 3/5 is slope 5/3? Wait, no:\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nThe direction vector [1, 3/5] – in terms of slope, it's (delta y)/(delta x) = (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But the required slope is 5/3. So, this is incorrect because 3/5 is the reciprocal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up? Let me see.\n\nIs there a scalar multiple that can make 3/5 into 5/3? No, it's not. Because 3/5 multiplied by k would have to equal 5/3, so k would be 5/3 divided by 3/5, which is (5/3)*(5/3)=25/9, which is a number, so direction vector [1, 3/5] *25/9 would give [25/9,5/3], which is a vector with slope 5/3.\n\nBut in Option D, the direction vector is [1,3/5], not scaled. So, no, the direction is incorrect. So even if we scaled it, we can't adjust it here; it's given as [1, 3/5]. So, direction vector is wrong.\n\nSo, Option D is invalid because the direction vector doesn't have the correct slope.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, let's compute whether [1, 3/5] is parallel to the line.\n\nThe direction vector [1, 3/5] when multiplied by 5/3 gives [5/3, 1], which is a direction vector with slope 1/(5/3) = 3/5, which is not 5/3. So, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, if direction vector were [3,5], that's slope 5/3, which is correct. But here, it's [1, 3/5], which is slope 3/5, incorrect.\n\nHence, Option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\nr = [0, -17/3] + t[15, -25]\nFirst, check initial point (0, -17/3). Plug x=0 into the line: y = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3. So, (0, -17/3) is on the line. Good.\n\nNow, direction vector [15, -25]. Compute slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3. Wait, slope is negative, which is opposite of 5/3. So, the direction vector has slope -5/3, which is a line with slope negative reciprocal, but in opposite direction.\n\nBut wait, direction vectors can point in the negative direction as well. Since slope is a direction, the slope of -5/3 is the opposite direction, but the line itself doesn't care about the direction; as long as the slope is correct. Wait, actually, for the parameterization, the direction vector can be in either direction along the line.\n\nSo, does this matter? Well, for a parameterization, the direction vector just needs to be parallel to the line, regardless of direction. So, the slope being -5/3 is opposite, but it's still parallel because the line extends infinitely in both directions. So, actually, direction vector's slope just needs to be same as line's slope, regardless of direction.\n\nWait, that's not entirely correct. Because if the direction vector has a slope of -5/3, that is, it's going in the opposite direction. However, since the line is the same regardless of direction, technically, the direction vector could be either (3,5) or (-3,-5) etc. So, does slope just have to have magnitude 5/3? Or does it have to have the exact slope?\n\nHmm, actually, in a parameterization, as long as the direction vector is parallel to the line, meaning their slopes are equal. So, the slope of the direction vector should be equal to 5/3. If the direction vector is [15, -25], which gives slope -25/15 = -5/3, which is not 5/3. So, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, hold on. Is direction vector's slope equal to 5/3 or its magnitude?\n\nNo, the direction vector has a slope of -5/3, but the line itself has a slope of 5/3. So, unless the direction vector's slope is the same as the line's slope, it's not parallel. So, since -5/3 ≠ 5/3, it's not parallel.\n\nSo, that would make the parameterization incorrect because the direction vector is not along the line. Therefore, Option E is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider scalar multiples, direction vector needs to be a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector. Here, [15, -25] is not a multiple of [3,5], because 15 is 5*3, but -25 is -5*5, which is a scalar multiple of [3,-5]. Since [3,5] is the direction vector of the line, [3,-5] is not a parallel direction.\n\nTherefore, direction vector in E is not parallel to the line, so Option E is invalid.\n\nWait, but to clarify: the direction vector doesn't have to be in the same direction, just in any scalar multiple, positive or negative. So, actually, [15, -25] is 5*[3, -5], which is a direction vector of a line with slope -5/3, as previously calculated.\n\nSo, in this case, the direction vector [15, -25] is a scalar multiple of [3, -5], which is a different direction. Since the original line has a direction vector [3,5], E's direction vector isn't a scalar multiple of [3,5], so it's not parallel, hence incorrect.\n\nSo, Option E is invalid.\n\nLet me just confirm once more to make sure.\n\nIn a parameterization, the direction vector must be parallel to the line's direction vector. So, for y = (5/3)x -17/3, the direction vector should be a scalar multiple of (3,5). If the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3,5), then it's correct.\n\nLooking back, in Option A, direction vector is (-3,-5), which is (-1)*(3,5), so it's parallel. In Option C, direction vector is (3/5,1) = (3,5)*(1/5), so also a scalar multiple. Options B, D, E either have the wrong initial point or have a direction vector not parallel to (3,5).\n\nTherefore, only Option A and Option C are valid.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in my initial analysis, Option E had an initial point on the line, but a direction vector with slope -5/3, which is different.\n\nIs there any chance that direction vector's slope -5/3 is parallel?\n\nNo, because a line with slope 5/3 and another with slope -5/3 are not parallel; they are perpendicular. Since the negative reciprocal would be -3/5, not 5/3. So, definitely, not parallel.\n\nTherefore, only A and C are valid.\n\nWait, but wait another moment: in Option C, the direction vector is (3/5, 1). So, (3/5,1) corresponds to the change in x=3/5, change in y=1.\n\nSo, the slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, which is correct. So, yes, that is a direction vector for the line. So, that's correct.\n\nIn Option A, direction vector (-3, -5): slope is 5/3, correct, as we saw.\n\nSo, both A and C.\n\nWait, hold on, earlier when I did Option C, the direction vector was (3/5, 1), and I concluded that it's a scalar multiple of (3,5). Let's check:\n\n(3/5, 1) = (3,5)*(1/5). So, yes, it's a scalar multiple, correct. So, slope is same as (3,5): 5/3.\n\nTherefore, both A and C have direction vectors that are scalar multiples of (3,5). Therefore, both A and C are correct.\n\nIn Options B, D, E, initial points are incorrect (B and E) or direction vectors have wrong slope (D). Therefore, only A and C.\n\nBut wait, wait, hold on a second. Let me check Option C again, because when I compute the direction vector (3/5, 1), slope is (delta y)/(delta x) =1/(3/5)=5/3. So that's correct, yes.\n\nBut wait, sometimes, when dealing with parametric equations, the direction vector is often expressed with integer components. So, is (3,5) the same as (3/5,1)?\n\nWait, no. (3/5,1) is a different vector, but it is a scalar multiple. So, in parametric terms, it's acceptable to have fractions in the direction vector. The parameterization doesn't necessarily have to use integer vectors; any direction vector is okay as long as it's a multiple.\n\nSo, for example, both (3,5) and (6,10) are acceptable direction vectors because they are scalar multiples.\n\nSimilarly, (3/5,1) is also acceptable as it's a scalar multiple.\n\nSo, in that case, both A and C have direction vectors that are scalar multiples of (3,5). So, both are correct.\n\nTherefore, my final conclusion is that the valid parameterizations are Options A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C, so the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n\nBut the instructions say to enter the letters separated by commas within a single box. So, perhaps in the format \\boxed{A,C}.\n\nWait, actually, the user instruction says: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\"\n\nSo, maybe within a single box, like \\boxed{A,C}\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is \\boxed{A,C}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: \n\n1.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) are valid. There are five options labeled (A) through (E). I remember that a parameterization of a line typically requires two things: a point on the line and a direction vector that's parallel to the line. So, I need to check each option to see if both of these conditions are met.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the general form of a parameterization is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) is a point on the line, and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is a direction vector. So, for each option, I should:\n\n1. Check if the given point \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) lies on the line. That means plugging the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) coordinates into the line equation and seeing if it holds true.\n2. Check if the direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is parallel to the line. To do this, I can see if the direction vector has a slope equal to the slope of the line.\n\nI also know that two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. So, I can verify if the direction vector is a multiple of the line's direction vector.\n\nThe original line is \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), so its slope is \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). Therefore, any direction vector should have a slope that is equal to \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). Alternatively, the direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} \\) should satisfy \\( \\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), meaning \\( 3v_y = 5v_x \\).\n\nOkay, let me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):** \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if the point (4,1) lies on the line. Plug x = 4 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\). So, yes, (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nThe slope of this vector is \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which is equal to the slope of the line. Alternatively, checking if \\( 3*(-5) = 5*(-3) \\) gives -15 = -15, which is true. So, the direction vector is valid.\n\nTherefore, Option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):** \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nCheck if (17,5) lies on the line:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} \\)\n\nCalculate \\( \\frac{5}{3}(17) = \\frac{85}{3} \\) and subtract \\( \\frac{17}{3} \\) gives \\( \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.6667 \\). But the given y is 5, so 5 ≠ 22.6667. Therefore, (17,5) is not on the line.\n\nSo, Option (B) is invalid.\n\nBut just for thoroughness, let me check the direction vector.\n\nThe direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope is \\( \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which matches the line's slope. So, even though the direction vector is correct, since the point isn't on the line, Option (B) is invalid.\n\n**Option (C):** \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x = 2 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\). So, yes, it is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let me compute the slope: \\( \\frac{1}{3/5} = \\frac{5}{3} \\), which matches the line's slope.\n\nAlternatively, checking if \\( 3*1 = 5*(3/5) \\). So, 3 = 3. That's true. Therefore, the direction vector is valid.\n\nSo, Option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):** \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nCheck if (14/5, -1) lies on the line.\n\nPlug x = 14/5 into the line equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(14/5) - \\frac{17}{3} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{5}{3}*(14/5) = 14/3 \\). So, \\( y = 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1 \\). So, yes, the point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nSlope is \\( (3/5)/1 = 3/5 \\). Wait, the slope of the line is 5/3, so 3/5 is not equal to 5/3. They are reciprocals but not the same. So, the direction vector's slope is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is not parallel to the line. Thus, Option (D) is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, check if \\( 3*(3/5) = 5*(1) \\)? \\( 9/5 = 5 \\). That's 1.8 vs. 5, which is not equal. So, direction vector is incorrect.\n\n**Option (E):** \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nPlugging x = 0 into the line equation: \\( y = 0 - 17/3 = -17/3 \\). So, yes, (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope is \\( -25/15 = -5/3 \\). Wait, that is -5/3, but the slope of the line is 5/3.\n\nSo, is a direction vector with a slope of -5/3 parallel to the line? Well, the direction vector only needs to have the same slope, regardless of direction. So, technically, if the direction vector's slope is a multiple that can result in the same direction as the line, but actually, slope is direction-dependent.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, a vector with slope -5/3 is not parallel to a vector with slope 5/3. Because two vectors are parallel if they have the same slope or slope negatives, but in this case, one is positive 5/3, the other is negative 5/3, which are negative reciprocals. That actually makes them perpendicular, not parallel.\n\nWait, is that right? Wait, the slope is rise over run. So, a vector (15, -25) has a slope of -25/15, which is -5/3. The line has slope 5/3. So, these slopes are negative of each other. So, they are not the same. So, the direction vector is not parallel to the line.\n\nAlternatively, checking if \\( 3*(-25) = 5*15 \\). Let's see:\n\nLeft side: 3*(-25) = -75\n\nRight side: 5*15 = 75\n\nSo, -75 ≠ 75, so the direction vector is not a scalar multiple. So, Option (E) is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the direction vector, if the slope is negative of the line's slope, it would point in the opposite direction but still be parallel? Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. If the slope is the negative reciprocal, then the vectors are perpendicular. If they're just negatives, then they're pointing in opposite directions but same line, so still parallel.\n\nWait, is that true? Let me think. For two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. So, if the direction vector is pointing in the exact opposite direction, but same line, that's still parallel, right?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose I have a vector (3,5) which has a slope of 5/3. If I have another vector (-3,-5), which is just a negative multiple, it has a slope of (-5)/(-3)=5/3, which is the same as (3,5). So, both vectors are parallel, because they have the same slope.\n\nWait, but in Option (E), the direction vector is (15, -25). Its slope is -25/15 = -5/3, which is different from 5/3. So, in that case, it's not the same slope, so they're not parallel. So, maybe Option (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I confused myself.\n\nWait, let's do this carefully.\n\nSuppose a direction vector (a, b) has a slope of b/a.\n\nFor the line, the slope is 5/3.\n\nIf direction vector has slope equal to 5/3, then b/a must be equal to 5/3.\n\nIn Option (E), direction vector is (15, -25).\n\nSo, slope is -25/15 = -5/3 ≠ 5/3.\n\nHence, not parallel.\n\nAlternatively, is -5/3 = 5/3? No, they are negatives. So, the direction vector is not parallel. Thus, Option (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps the direction vector could have a slope of negative 5/3 but still be considered parallel? Because in terms of direction, it's still a multiple.\n\nWait, no, because being parallel is about the same direction or opposite direction, but the slope should have the same absolute value? Or is it about the same direction?\n\nNo, the slope is a scalar. So, if the direction vector's slope is same as the line, then it's parallel. If it's negative reciprocal, that's perpendicular.\n\nSo, in this case, since (15, -25) has a slope of -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3, so it's not parallel.\n\nHence, Option (E) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, among all options, only (A) and (C) are valid parameterizations.\n\nWait, let me double-check each.\n\nFor Option (A):\n\nPoint (4,1) is on the line: yes.\n\nDirection vector slope is 5/3: yes.\n\nValid.\n\nOption (B):\n\nPoint (17,5) is not on the line: incorrect.\n\nHence, invalid.\n\nOption (C):\n\nPoint (2, -7/3) is on the line: yes.\n\nDirection vector has slope 5/3: yes.\n\nValid.\n\nOption (D):\n\nPoint (14/5, -1) is on the line: yes.\n\nBut direction vector has slope 3/5: not 5/3, so invalid.\n\nOption (E):\n\nPoint (0, -17/3) is on the line: yes.\n\nBut direction vector has slope -5/3: not equal to 5/3, so invalid.\n\nThus, the valid options are (A) and (C).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nHowever, since the instructions say to enter the letters separated by commas inside a single box, the final answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) are valid, we need to check two conditions for each option: if the given point lies on the line and if the direction vector is parallel to the line (i.e., has the same slope).\n\n1. **Option (A):** \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Point (4, 1) is on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations of the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3 are correct. Let's see. I remember that a parameterization of a line requires two things: a point on the line and a direction vector. So, each of these options is given in the form of a vector equation, which is perfect because I can check if the point is on the line and if the direction vector is correct.\n\nFirst, I think I should recall how to check if a point lies on a given line. It's straightforward: I just plug in the x and y values into the equation and see if the equation holds true. Also, for the direction vector, it should be a scalar multiple of the line's slope. Since the slope of the given line is 5/3, the direction vector's components should satisfy the ratio 5/3, meaning if the direction vector is <a, b>, then b/a should be equal to 5/3, or equivalently, b = (5/3)a. Alternatively, I can check if the vector is a scalar multiple of <3,5> because 5/3 is the slope.\n\nOkay, so I'll go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: [x; y] = [4; 1] + t[-3; -5]. Let me first check if the point (4,1) lies on the line y = (5/3)x -17/3. Plugging x=4 into the equation: (5/3)*4 = 20/3. Then 20/3 -17/3 = 3/3 =1. So y=1. That means (4,1) is indeed on the line. Good.\n\nNext, check the direction vector. It's [-3; -5]. The slope of this vector is -5/-3 = 5/3, which matches the slope of the given line. So, since the direction vector is correct and the point lies on the line, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\nOption B: [x; y] = [17;5] + t[6;10]. First, check if (17,5) is on the line. Plug x=17 into y = (5/3)x -17/3: (5/3)*17 = 85/3 ≈28.333... Subtract 17/3≈5.666..., so y=85/3 -17/3=68/3≈22.666... But the point given has y=5, which is clearly not equal to 68/3. So the point is not on the line. Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I did that wrong. Let me compute it more carefully. (5/3)*17 = (85)/3. Then 85/3 -17/3 = (85 -17)/3 = 68/3, which is approximately 22.666..., not 5. So, yeah, (17,5) is definitely not on the line. So B is out.\n\nOption C: [x; y] = [2; -7/3] + t[3/5;1]. Let's check the point first. x=2, y=-7/3. Plugging x=2 into the line equation: y=(5/3)*2 -17/3 =10/3 -17/3= (-7)/3. So y=-7/3. That matches. Good, so the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector. It's [3/5;1]. The slope is 1 divided by (3/5) =5/3. Which matches the slope of the line. So, direction vector is correct. Therefore, Option C is valid.\n\nOption D: [x; y] = [14/5; -1] + t[1; 3/5]. Check the point (14/5, -1). Plug x=14/5 into the line equation: (5/3)*(14/5)=14/3≈4.666... Subtract 17/3≈5.666..., so y=14/3 -17/3= -3/3=-1. So y=-1. Perfect, the point is on the line.\n\nNow check the direction vector. [1; 3/5]. The slope is (3/5)/1=3/5. Wait, the slope of the line is 5/3, but the direction vector slope here is 3/5. That's the reciprocal. So that would mean the line is different. Actually, 3/5 is not equal to 5/3, so the direction vector is incorrect. So even though the point is on the line, the direction vector is wrong. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nOption E: [x; y] = [0; -17/3] + t[15; -25]. First, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line. Plugging x=0 into the equation: y=(5/3)*0 -17/3= -17/3. So yes, the point is on the line. Great.\n\nNow, check the direction vector [15; -25]. The slope is -25/15. Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 5, we get -5/3. But the slope of the line is 5/3, so the direction vector has a slope of -5/3, which is negative reciprocal, so it's pointing in the opposite direction but still parallel? Wait, no. Since a line is infinitely long in both directions, technically, direction vectors with scalar multiples will just point in opposite directions but still lie on the same line.\n\nBut wait, in parameterizations, direction vectors must be consistent. Let me think. So, if the direction vector is [15; -25], which is equivalent to [3; -5] after dividing by 5. Wait, because 15/5=3, and -25/5=-5. So the direction vector is [3; -5], which is just a scalar multiple (specifically, scaled by 5) of [3; -5]. However, the original line's slope is 5/3, so a direction vector that lies along this line must have components that, when slope calculated, give 5/3.\n\nWait, slope of direction vector [3;5] would be 5/3, but [3; -5] would have slope -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3. So even though [3; -5] is a scalar multiple of the direction vector in Option A, it's not a direction vector that is consistent with the original line.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it more directly: the line y = (5/3)x -17/3 is going upwards to the right. So, a direction vector should also go upwards to the right. If the direction vector in Option E is [15; -25], then for every 15 units to the right, it goes down 25 units, which is going to the right and down. So that's a vector that's pointing in a downward direction, which is not the same as the original line.\n\nSo, even though the point is on the line, the direction vector is incorrect. Thus, Option E is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on. Did I make a mistake here? Because [15; -25] is a scalar multiple of [3; -5], but [3; -5] has a slope of -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3. So yes, the direction vector is still not correct. So the parameterization is for a line with a different slope, even though it's a scalar multiple.\n\nTherefore, Option E is invalid.\n\nSo, recapping:\n\nOption A: Valid.\n\nOption B: Invalid.\n\nOption C: Valid.\n\nOption D: Invalid.\n\nOption E: Invalid.\n\nThus, the correct options are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) are valid, we need to check two things for each option: whether the given point lies on the line and whether the direction vector is correct.\n\n1. **Option A**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n   - Check if (4, 1) is on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = 1\n     \\]\n     The point (4, 1) is on the line.\n   - Check the direction vector: The slope is \\(\\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\\), which matches the line's slope.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n2. **Option B**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n   - Check if (17, 5) is on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\neq 5\n     \\]\n     The point (17, 5) is not on the line.\n   - Conclusion: Invalid.\n\n3. **Option C**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -\\frac{7}{3} \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n   - Check if (2, \\(-\\frac{7}{3}\\)) is on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}\n     \\]\n     The point (2, \\(-\\frac{7}{3}\\)) is on the line.\n   - Check the direction vector: The slope is \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{5}{3}\\), which matches the line's slope.\n   - Conclusion: Valid.\n\n4. **Option D**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{14}{5} \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\frac{3}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n   - Check if (\\(\\frac{14}{5}\\), -1) is on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3}\\left(\\frac{14}{5}\\right) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -1\n     \\]\n     The point (\\(\\frac{14}{5}\\), -1) is on the line.\n   - Check the direction vector: The slope is \\(\\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{1} = \\frac{3}{5}\\), which does not match the line's slope \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\).\n   - Conclusion: Invalid.\n\n5. **Option E**: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -\\frac{17}{3} \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n   - Check if (0, \\(-\\frac{17}{3}\\)) is on the line:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3}\n     \\]\n     The point (0, \\(-\\frac{17}{3}\\)) is on the line.\n   - Check the direction vector: The slope is \\(\\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3}\\), which does not match the line's slope \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\).\n   - Conclusion: Invalid.\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options \\(\\boxed{A}\\) and \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",

                "full_response": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations are valid for the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, okay. Let me recall what a parameterization of a line using vectors involves.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a parameterization of a line in vector form is generally written as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r_0} + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{r_0}\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the direction vector of the line. So, to check each option, I need to make sure two things: \n1. The given point \\(\\mathbf{r_0}\\) lies on the line.\n2. The direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is parallel to the line, meaning its direction matches the slope of the line.\n\nGiven the line equation, I can write it in slope-intercept form, which it already is: y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So the slope here is 5/3. Therefore, the direction vector should have a slope equivalent to 5/3, or in other words, if the direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\), then b/a should equal 5/3.\n\nWait, but direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. So, for example, a direction vector like \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) would be valid because 5/3 is the slope. Similarly, \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is also valid because -5/-3 = 5/3. So the direction vector's slope has to match the given line's slope, but it can be in the same direction or opposite direction as long as the ratio is consistent.\n\nAlright, now let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option (A):\n\n(A) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nFirst, check if the point (4,1) lies on the line. Let's plug x=4 into the equation of the line:\n\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\nOkay, so when x=4, y=1, which matches the given point. So (4,1) is indeed on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). The slope here is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which is the same as the line's slope. So this direction vector is valid.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\nMoving on to option (B):\n\n(B) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nFirst, check if the point (17,5) is on the line. Plug x=17 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3 = 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\n\nBut the y-value given is 5, which is not equal to 68/3. So (17,5) is not on the line. Hence, option (B) is invalid.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, I might have miscalculated. Let me compute again:\n\n(5/3)*17 = (85)/3 ≈ 28.333..., then subtract 17/3 which is approximately 5.666..., so 28.333... - 5.666... = 22.666..., which is indeed approximately 68/3, not 5. So yes, (17,5) is not on the line.\n\nMoving on to option (C):\n\n(C) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nFirst, let's check if (2, -7/3) is on the line. Plug x=2 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = (-7)/3 ≈ -2.333...\n\nWhich matches the given y-value of -7/3. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Let's compute its slope: (1)/(3/5) = 5/3, which is the same as the line's slope. So this direction vector is also valid.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? The direction vector is (3/5, 1). The slope is 1 divided by (3/5), which is indeed 5/3. So yes, the direction is correct. So (C) is good.\n\nMoving to option (D):\n\n(D) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line. Let's compute y when x=14/5:\n\ny = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1.\n\nPerfect, so the point is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Compute its slope: (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But the slope of our line is 5/3, so is 3/5 equal to 5/3? No, because 3/5 is the reciprocal of 5/3. So actually, the direction vector here is of slope 3/5, which is different from the given line's slope of 5/3.\n\nWait, hold on, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). So the change in y over change in x is 3/5 divided by 1, which is 3/5. So that's a slope of 3/5, which is not equal to 5/3. So that means this direction vector is not parallel to the given line. Therefore, this parameterization would not lie on the line, except at the specific t value.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is invalid because the direction vector has the wrong slope.\n\nWait a minute, but in my calculation, the direction vector is slope 3/5, and the line has slope 5/3, which are not the same. Therefore, the direction vector is not correct. So (D) is invalid.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me think again. Maybe if the direction vector is in the opposite direction? Let me see. For a direction vector to be parallel to the line, the slope must match. So in this case, 3/5 is not equal to 5/3, so the direction vector is not in the correct direction. Therefore, (D) is invalid.\n\nWait, but if the direction vector was (5,3), then the slope would be 3/5, right? Or wait, (5,3) would be slope 3/5, while (-5, -3) is slope 3/5. But in the given line, the slope is 5/3. Hmm, so you need a direction vector that has a slope of 5/3. So either (3,5) or (-3,-5) would be correct direction vectors.\n\nSo the direction vector in (D) is (1, 3/5), which is slope 3/5, which is not the same as 5/3. Therefore, (D) is incorrect.\n\nProceeding to option (E):\n\n(E) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nFirst, check if the point (0, -17/3) is on the line. When x=0,\n\ny = (5/3)(0) - 17/3 = -17/3, which matches the given y-coordinate. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Compute its slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nWait, the slope here is -5/3. But the given line has a slope of 5/3. So they're not the same; in fact, they're negative reciprocals? Wait, no, negative reciprocal would be -3/5. So -5/3 is just the negative of 5/3.\n\nSo, in terms of direction, the direction vector is pointing in the opposite direction compared to the line's slope. However, for a line, the direction can be in either direction, positive or negative, as long as the slope matches. So, actually, if the direction vector is pointing the opposite way, as long as the slope is correct in magnitude, it's still considered a valid direction vector.\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Let me recall: when a vector is added to a point, the parameter t can be any real number, positive or negative. So even if the direction vector is reversed in direction, by changing t, you can still move in the positive direction of the line.\n\nWait, let me clarify: if the direction vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\), then as t increases, the point moves in the direction of the vector. If the vector is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -a \\\\ -b \\end{pmatrix}\\), then as t increases, the point moves in the opposite direction. But the slope is still the same because both the direction vector and its negative would give the same slope. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, suppose we have two direction vectors: (a, b) and (-a, -b). The slopes are both b/a, because (-b)/(-a) = b/a. So both direction vectors have the same slope, which is consistent with the line's slope. Therefore, regardless of the direction, as long as the slope is the same, it's a valid direction vector.\n\nTherefore, in option (E), the direction vector is (15, -25). The slope is (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is the negative of the given slope. Wait, no, hold on: slope is rise over run, so it's -25 over 15, which is -5/3. But the given slope is 5/3, which is positive. So in this case, the direction vector is actually in the opposite direction to the line's slope.\n\nBut that's okay, because direction vectors can point either way as long as the line is correct. However, we have to check if the slope is consistent. But here, slope is negative, whereas the line's slope is positive. So that's a problem, right?\n\nWait, so if the direction vector is (15, -25), it's going in the direction of positive x and negative y, which would be a slope of -5/3, which is different from the given line's slope of 5/3. So that would mean the line described by (E) would have a different slope.\n\nWait, hold on, let's think differently. Maybe I can write the equation from the parameterization and see if it matches the given line.\n\nFrom option (E):\n\nx(t) = 0 + 15t\n\ny(t) = -17/3 + (-25)t\n\nSo, can we solve for y in terms of x?\n\nFrom x(t), t = x / 15\n\nSubstitute into y(t):\n\ny = -17/3 -25*(x / 15) = -17/3 - (25/15)x = -17/3 - (5/3)x\n\nWhich simplifies to y = (-5/3)x -17/3\n\nWait, but the original line is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. So, this is a different line. The slope is -5/3 instead of 5/3. So, that means option (E) parameterization does not lie on the original line. Therefore, (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought about direction vectors. Maybe because in this case, even though the direction vector is a scalar multiple, but in the opposite direction, it's not the same as the original line's direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the slope. Let me compute the slope correctly.\n\nGiven the direction vector (15, -25), the slope would be (change in y)/(change in x) = (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is different from the given line's 5/3. So, yeah, that is indeed a different slope.\n\nTherefore, the parameterization in (E) is invalid because the direction vector does not give the same slope as the original line.\n\nWait, hold on, but isn't 15 and -25 a multiple of 3 and -5? Let me check:\n\n15 = 3 * 5, -25 = 5 * (-5). So the direction vector can be written as 5*(3, -5). So, it's 5 times (3, -5). So, the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3, -5), which is a different direction from (3,5). Therefore, (E) gives a different line, not the same line.\n\nHence, (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, but someone might say that direction vectors can point in opposite directions as long as the line's slope is the same. But in this case, the slope is different. So, that's why it's invalid.\n\nSo, stepping back:\n\n(A): Point on line, slope correct. Valid.\n\n(B): Point not on line. Invalid.\n\n(C): Point on line, slope correct. Valid.\n\n(D): Point on line, slope incorrect. Invalid.\n\n(E): Point on line, slope incorrect. Invalid.\n\nHence, only options (A) and (C) are valid.\n\nBut wait, earlier, in (E), I thought maybe direction vector is just a multiple, but actually, since the direction vector is scaled by 5, but with opposite signs, which gives a different slope. So (E) is invalid.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can plug in some t value into (E) and see if the point lies on the line.\n\nLet me set t = 0: (0, -17/3), which is on the original line. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, set t = 1: (15, -17/3 -25) = (15, -17/3 -75/3) = (15, -92/3). Let me plug x = 15 into the original line: y = (5/3)(15) - 17/3 = 75/3 -17/3 = 58/3 ≈ 19.333..., but according to parameterization, y is -92/3 ≈ -30.666... So, that's way off. Therefore, point doesn't lie on the original line, so parameterization is invalid.\n\nHence, (E) is indeed invalid.\n\nWait, but when I checked earlier by plugging in t, I saw that x is increasing but y is decreasing, giving a different slope. So, yeah, it's not the same line. So, (E) is wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe just (A) and (C) are correct. Let me just verify with one more t value.\n\nIn (A), when t = 1: x = 4 -3 = 1, y = 1 -5 = -4.\n\nPlug into original line: y = (5/3)(1) -17/3 = 5/3 -17/3 = -12/3 = -4. So that's correct.\n\nWhen t = 2: x = 4 -6 = -2, y = 1 -10 = -9.\n\nPlug into original line: y = (5/3)(-2) -17/3 = -10/3 -17/3 = -27/3 = -9. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, (A) is solid.\n\nIn (C), point is (2, -7/3). Slope is 5/3. Let's test t=1:\n\nx = 2 + (3/5)(1) = 2 + 0.6 = 2.6\n\ny = -7/3 + 1*(1) = -7/3 + 1 = -4/3 ≈ -1.333...\n\nWait, let me compute y from the original line at x=2.6:\n\n2.6 is 13/5, so y = (5/3)*(13/5) -17/3 = (13/3) -17/3 = (-4)/3 ≈ -1.333...\n\nWhich matches the parameterization. So, (C) is correct as well.\n\nTo confirm, in (C), if I pick t=5:\n\nx = 2 + 3/5*5 = 2 + 3 = 5\n\ny = -7/3 + 1*5 = -7/3 + 15/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...\n\nPlug into the original line: y = (5/3)(5) -17/3 = 25/3 -",

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations of the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3 are valid. Hmm, parameterizing a line with vectors... I remember that a line can be written in vector form as a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. So, each option is given as a starting point plus a direction vector scaled by t. I need to check for each option if the starting point lies on the line and if the direction vector is parallel to the line.\n\nFirst, let's recall the slope of the line. The equation is given as y = (5/3)x - 17/3, so the slope (m) is 5/3. That means the direction vector should have a slope equal to 5/3, so the direction vector (a, b) should satisfy b/a = 5/3, or equivalently, 3b = 5a.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\nStarting point is (4, 1). Let's check if this point lies on the line. Plugging x = 4 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1. So y = 1, which matches the y-coordinate of the starting point. So, this point is on the line.\n\nNext, the direction vector is (-3, -5). Let's check if this is parallel to the line. The slope of this vector is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which is the same as the slope of the line. So, this direction vector is valid. Therefore, option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\nStarting point is (17, 5). Let's check if this point is on the line. Plugging x = 17 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3 = (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666... But the y-coordinate is given as 5. 68/3 is approximately 22.666, not 5. So, this point does not lie on the line. Therefore, option (B) is invalid.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If x = 17, then y should be (5/3)(17) - 17/3. Let's compute (5/3)*17 = 85/3, and subtract 17/3, which is 68/3, which is about 22.666, not 5. Yep, so it's not on the line. So (B) is invalid.\n\n**Option (C):**\nStarting point is (2, -7/3). Let's check if this is on the line. Plugging x = 2 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(2) - 17/3 = 10/3 - 17/3 = -7/3. Perfect, that's the y-coordinate given. So, the starting point is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is (3/5, 1). Let's compute its slope: 1 divided by (3/5) is 1 * (5/3) = 5/3. That matches the slope of the line. So, the direction vector is valid. Therefore, option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):**\nStarting point is (14/5, -1). Let's check if this is on the line. x = 14/5, so let's plug into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(14/5) - 17/3\n\nSimplify (5/3)(14/5) = (14/3). Then, 14/3 - 17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. The y-coordinate is -1, which matches. So, the starting point is on the line.\n\nNext, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). Let's compute its slope: (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Wait, that's 3/5, which is not the same as the slope of the line (5/3). So, they are not parallel. Therefore, this direction vector is invalid for the given line. Hence, option (D) is not a valid parameterization.\n\nBut hold on, sometimes direction vectors can be scaled. If the direction vector's slope is the reciprocal with the wrong sign, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me see. The line's slope is 5/3, so any direction vector with a slope of 5/3 or -5/3 would be parallel. Here, the direction vector has a slope of 3/5, which is not the same. So, indeed, it's not parallel. So (D) is invalid.\n\n**Option (E):**\nStarting point is (0, -17/3). Let's check if this is on the line. Plugging x = 0 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(0) - 17/3 = -17/3, which matches the given y-coordinate. So, the starting point is on the line.\n\nDirection vector is (15, -25). Let's compute its slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3. Wait, the slope is -5/3, which is not equal to the slope of the line, which is 5/3. However, is a slope of -5/3 considered parallel?\n\nWait, actually, two lines with slopes m1 and m2 are parallel if m1 = m2 or if m1 * m2 = 1 for non-vertical/horizontal lines. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, lines are parallel if their slopes are equal. If they are negative reciprocals, they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, if the direction vector has a slope that is negative reciprocal, it's perpendicular, not parallel. So, in this case, the slope is -5/3. Since the line's slope is 5/3, the direction vector's slope is not equal, so it's not parallel. Therefore, it's invalid. Hmm, wait, but is slope -5/3 parallel or not?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The direction vector's slope is -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3, so it's not parallel. But if we consider direction vectors, they can be scalar multiples as long as the slope is the same. But here, the slope of the direction vector is negative, but not equal. So, that means the direction vector is not parallel.\n\nAlternatively, if we parameterize with a direction vector that's a scalar multiple of (3,5), that's slope 5/3, which is our line's slope. But (15, -25) is a multiple: 15 is 3*5, and -25 is -5*5, so if you factor out 5, you get (3, -5). The direction vector (3, -5) has a slope of -5/3, which is the negative reciprocal. That would be a perpendicular direction, not parallel.\n\nHence, (15, -25) as a direction vector would be invalid for this line because it's not parallel. So option (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, but is that correct? If the direction vector is (15, -25), which is equivalent to 5*(3, -5). And since (3, -5) has a slope of -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3, the original line's slope. So, yeah, that would mean it's a different line, not parallel. So (E) is invalid.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe if we factor out differently. Let me think. If I factor out 5, it's 5*(3, -5), so the direction is still the same. Yeah, same conclusion.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n(A) Valid\n(B) Invalid (starting point not on the line)\n(C) Valid\n(D) Invalid (direction vector slope doesn't match)\n(E) Invalid\n\nTherefore, the correct options are (A) and (C).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C), so the answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations of the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\) are valid, we need to check two things for each option: if the starting point lies on the line and if the direction vector is parallel to the line (i.e., has the same slope, \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\)).\n\n**Option (A):**\n- Starting point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n  - Check if it lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\) ✓\n- Direction vector: \\( (-3, -5) \\)\n  - Slope: \\( \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) ✓\n- Valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\n- Starting point: \\( (17, 5) \\)\n  - Check if it lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\neq 5 \\) ✗\n- Invalid parameterization.\n\n**Option (C):**\n- Starting point: \\( (2, -\\frac{7}{3}) \\)\n  - Check if it lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) ✓\n- Direction vector: \\( \\left( \\frac{3}{5}, 1 \\right) \\)\n  - Slope: \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) ✓\n- Valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):**\n- Starting point: \\( \\left( \\frac{14}{5}, -1 \\right) \\)\n  - Check if it lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3} \\left( \\frac{14}{5} \\right) - \\frac{17}{3} = -1 \\) ✓\n- Direction vector: \\( (1, \\frac{3}{5}) \\)\n  - Slope: \\( \\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{1} = \\frac{3}{5} \\) ✗\n- Invalid parameterization.\n\n**Option (E):**\n- Starting point: \\( (0, -\\frac{17}{3}) \\)\n  - Check if it lies on the line: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3} \\) ✓\n- Direction vector: \\( (15, -25) \\)\n  - Slope: \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\) ✗\n- Invalid parameterization.\n\nThus, the valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A,C}\n\\]",

There are five options labeled (A) through (E). Hmm, okay, let me recall how to parameterize a line using vectors.\n\nFirst, a parameterization of a line typically looks like this: \n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\mathbf{r}_0 \\) is a specific point on the line (position vector) and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is a direction vector that is parallel to the line.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to check two things:\n1. Does the given point \\( \\mathbf{r}_0 \\) lie on the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\)?\n2. Is the direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) a scalar multiple of the direction vector corresponding to the line?\n\nLet me find the direction vector of the line first. The given equation is in slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope. Here, the slope \\( m = \\frac{5}{3} \\). So, the direction vector should be a vector that has a slope of \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). Common choices are \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) or any scalar multiple of this vector, like \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\), \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), etc.\n\nSo, the direction vector should be of the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3k \\\\ 5k \\end{pmatrix} \\) where \\( k \\) is a non-zero scalar.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if \\( (4, 1) \\) lies on the line.\n\nPlug \\( x = 4 \\) into the line equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1\n\\]\nYes, the point \\( (4, 1) \\) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's see if this is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nIf we multiply \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) by \\( -1 \\), we get \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is exactly the direction vector given. So, the direction is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option (A) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if \\( (17, 5) \\) is on the line.\n\nPlug \\( x = 17 \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{85}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\approx 22.666...\n\\]\nBut the y-coordinate here is 5, which doesn't match. Therefore, \\( (17, 5) \\) is not on the line.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, plugging \\( x = 17 \\) into the line equation gives approximately 22.666, not 5, so definitely not on the line. So, this parameterization is invalid because the point isn't on the line.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, I'll check the direction vector as well. Direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Is this a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)?\n\nYes, multiplying \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) by 2 gives \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, the direction is correct, but since the starting point is off the line, the entire parameterization doesn't lie on the given line. Therefore, (B) is invalid.\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if \\( (2, -7/3) \\) is on the line.\n\nPlug \\( x = 2 \\) into the line equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3}(2) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\nYes, that matches \\( y = -7/3 \\). So, the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWe need to see if this is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nLet me check if 3/5 and 3 are related by the same scalar, and similarly for 1 and 5.\n\nSuppose \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then,\n\n3/5 = 3k and 1 = 5k.\n\nFrom the second equation, 1 = 5k ⇒ k = 1/5.\n\nNow, check the first component:\n\n3/5 = 3*(1/5) = 3/5. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is indeed a scalar multiple (specifically, 1/5 of) \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, the direction is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option (C) is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if \\( (14/5, -1) \\) is on the line.\n\nCompute \\( y \\) when \\( x = 14/5 \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{14}{5} - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{3}{3} = -1\n\\]\nYes, that's correct. The point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nIs this a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)?\n\nLet me denote the direction vector as \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nSuppose \\( \\mathbf{v} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), then:\n\n1 = 3k ⇒ k = 1/3.\n\nCheck the second component:\n\n3/5 = 5k ⇒ 3/5 = 5*(1/3) ⇒ 3/5 = 5/3.\n\nWait, that's not true because 3/5 is approximately 0.6 and 5/3 is approximately 1.666...\n\nTherefore, 3/5 ≠ 5/3. So, \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nHence, the direction vector is not correct. Therefore, Option (D) is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me check again.\n\nGiven direction vector in (D): \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWe need to see if this is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nSo, let me denote \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3k \\\\ 5k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nThus,\n\n3k = 1 ⇒ k = 1/3.\n\n5k = 5*(1/3) = 5/3.\n\nBut in the direction vector, the second component is 3/5, not 5/3.\n\nSo, indeed, they don't match. Therefore, direction vector is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a scalar multiple through a negative? Let me check for negative scalar.\n\nIf we take k = -1/3, then:\n\n3*(-1/3) = -1, which doesn't help, and 5*(-1/3) = -5/3, still not matching 3/5.\n\nSo, no, it's not a scalar multiple. Therefore, direction vector is wrong.\n\nTherefore, (D) is invalid.\n\n**Option (E):**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if \\( (0, -17/3) \\) is on the line.\n\nPlug \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{3}(0) - \\frac{17}{3} = -\\frac{17}{3}\n\\]\nYes, the point \\( (0, -17/3) \\) is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nIs this a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)?\n\nLet's see: Let’s denote the direction vector as \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWe can test if \\( \\mathbf{v} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n15 = 3k ⇒ k = 5.\n\nThen, check the second component:\n\n5k = 5*5 = 25, but in \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), the second component is -25.\n\nSo, 5k = 25 ≠ -25. Therefore, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the line.\n\nWait, but hold on, the direction vector could be negative as well.\n\nLet me see, if \\( \\mathbf{v} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\), with k being any real number.\n\nSuppose 15 = 3k ⇒ k = 5.\n\nThen, -25 should equal 5k ⇒ 5*5=25 ≠ -25. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, suppose \\( \\mathbf{v} = k \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's check.\n\n15 = -3k ⇒ k = -5.\n\nThen, -25 should equal -5k = -5*(-5)=25. No, that's still not.\n\nWait, if we scale \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) by -5, we get \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). But our direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, the x-component is positive, but the y-component is negative.\n\nAlternatively, is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\) = scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)?\n\nIf so, then 15/3 = 5, and -25/5 = -5. Since 5 ≠ -5, it's not a scalar multiple.\n\nAlternatively, is it a scalar multiple with a negative k?\n\nIf we take k = 5, then \\( 3*5 =15 \\), \\(5*5=25\\), but the direction vector is 15, -25.\n\nAlternatively, k = -5: \\( 3*(-5)=-15 \\neq 15 \\), \\(5*(-5)=-25 \\). But since x-component doesn't match with k=-5, it's still not a scalar multiple.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Therefore, the direction is wrong.\n\nHence, Option (E) is invalid.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Maybe I made a mistake because -25 is a multiple of 5. Let's think differently. Maybe the direction vector was created by scaling both the x and y by different factors. But, for it to be a direction vector of the same line, it has to maintain the same slope.\n\nWait, slope of the direction vector \\( \\frac{-25}{15} = -5/3 \\). Wait, the slope of the line is 5/3, so if the direction vector has slope -5/3, that would actually be pointing in the opposite direction of the line, but the slope is negative, meaning it's decreasing, whereas the original line is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is actually going in the opposite direction of the line, meaning it's not parallel, but rather anti-parallel. So, since it's not parallel, it can't be a valid direction vector for the line.\n\nTherefore, Option (E) is invalid.\n\n**Reviewing the options:**\n\n- (A): Valid.\n- (B): Invalid (starting point not on line).\n- (C): Valid.\n- (D): Invalid (direction vector not parallel).\n- (E): Invalid (direction vector not parallel).\n\nWait, but hold on, just to double-check my conclusions. For (C), the direction vector is 1/5 of the standard direction vector, so yes, that's correct.\n\nFor (E), the direction vector has a different slope, since slope is -25/15 = -5/3, whereas the line has slope 5/3. Therefore, yes, direction vector is not parallel, which would mean the parameterization does not lie on the given line.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that only (A) and (C) are valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options (A) and (C), so the answer is \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more for (E). Suppose t is allowed to be any real number, positive or negative, could it still point along the line?\n\nThe direction vector for the line is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The given direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, let's see:\n\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n⇒ 15 = 3k ⇒ k=5\n⇒ -25 = 5k ⇒ k= -5\n\nSince k is not consistent, it's not a scalar multiple, so direction vector is invalid. So (E) is indeed invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for (D), the direction vector didn't scale correctly.\n\nSo, yeah, only (A) and (C) are valid. So, final answer is A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option:\n1. Does the given point \\( \\mathbf{r}_0 \\) lie on the line?\n2. Is the direction vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) a scalar multiple of the direction vector corresponding to the line?\n\nThe direction vector of the line is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) or any scalar multiple of this vector.\n\n**Option (A):**\n- Point: \\( (4, 1) \\) lies on the line.\n- Direction vector: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n- Valid parameterization.\n\n",

                "full_response": "Okay, I've got this problem here where I need to figure out which of the given options are valid parameterizations for the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, parameterizing a line usually involves choosing a point on the line and a direction vector, right? So each option gives me a point in vector form and a direction vector. I should check for each option whether the point lies on the line and whether the direction vector is parallel to the line's slope.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a line in slope-intercept form like y = mx + b, any direction vector must have a slope equal to m. Since the given line has a slope of 5/3, the direction vector should also have a slope of 5/3. Or, in other words, if the direction vector is (a, b), then b/a should equal 5/3. So that's one thing to check.\n\nAlso, each parameterization is given as a vector equation of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhere (x0, y0) is a specific point on the line, and (a, b) is the direction vector. So for each option (A) to (E), I need to:\n\n1. Check if (x0, y0) lies on the given line.\n2. Check if the direction vector (a, b) has a slope equal to 5/3.\n\nI'll go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (4, 1) is on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nPlug x = 4 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\nOkay, so y = 1 when x = 4, which matches the given point. So the point is on the line.\n\nNext, direction vector is (-3, -5). Let's compute its slope: rise over run is -5 / (-3) = 5/3.\n\nThat's exactly the slope of the line, so this direction vector is valid.\n\nSo option A is a valid parameterization. Got that.\n\n**Option B:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (17, 5) is on the line.\n\nPlug x = 17 into the equation:\ny = (5/3)(17) - 17/3 = (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666...\n\nBut the given y is 5. 68/3 is approximately 22.666, which is not 5. So the point is not on the line.\n\nWait, that might be a miscalculation. Wait, let me compute (5/3)*17:\n\n(5/3)*17 = 85/3 ≈ 28.333...\n\nThen 85/3 - 17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666..., yes, as I said before. So (17, 5) is not on the line y = (5/3)x -17/3. Therefore, option B is not a valid parameterization.\n\nAlternatively, if I thought that 5 = (5/3)*17 -17/3. Let me compute right-hand side:\n\n(5/3)*17 = 85/3, subtract 17/3: 85/3 -17/3 = 68/3. 68/3 is approximately 22.666..., which is not 5, so point is not on the line. So direction vector is not relevant here because the point is not on the line. Therefore, option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nCompute y when x=2:\n\ny = (5/3)*2 -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3 ≈ -2.333...\n\nWhich is exactly -7/3, so yes, the point is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector (3/5, 1). The slope is 1 / (3/5) = 5/3, which matches the slope of the line. So direction vector is valid.\n\nTherefore, option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nCompute y when x =14/5:\n\ny = (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3 = (14/3) -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1.\n\nSo y = -1, which is exactly the given y. So the point is on the line.\n\nNext, check direction vector (1, 3/5). The slope is (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Hmm, wait. That's different from the slope of the original line, which was 5/3.\n\nWait a second, is the slope 3/5 or 5/3? Let me compute slope as rise over run, which is 3/5 / 1 = 3/5. So the direction vector has slope 3/5, but the original line has slope 5/3.\n\nBut wait, 3/5 is the negative reciprocal of 5/3? Wait, no, the negative reciprocal of 5/3 would be -3/5, not 3/5. So if direction vector slope is 3/5, then the line it defines would have a slope of 3/5, which is different from 5/3.\n\nTherefore, direction vector is not in the same direction as the line's slope. So this parameterization is not valid, right?\n\nWait, actually, I need to verify the direction vector again. Let me recast it.\n\nWait, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). So to get the slope, we take (Δy / Δx) = (3/5)/1 = 3/5. Since the line has a slope of 5/3, which is different, so indeed, this direction vector is not parallel to the line.\n\nTherefore, even though the point is on the line, the direction vector isn't correct. So option D is invalid.\n\nBut wait, I should also make sure that they didn't use the negative reciprocal by mistake. But no, the slope is just 3/5, which doesn't match. So definitely, D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nCompute y when x = 0:\n\ny = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3. That's exactly the given point, so yes, it lies on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector (15, -25). Compute its slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nCompare with original line's slope of 5/3.\n\nSo, here, the direction vector has a slope of -5/3, which is the negative of the line's slope. But wait, the direction vector defines the direction of the line. So if the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the line's direction vector, it should have the same slope.\n\nBut in this case, the direction vector's slope is -5/3, which is different from 5/3.\n\nWait, but if we have a direction vector (a, b) and we multiply it by a scalar, say, -1, it gives (-a, -b), which still has the same slope, because slope is (-b)/(-a) = b/a.\n\nBut if the direction vector is scaled by a negative scalar, it's still the same slope.\n\nWait, in this case, the direction vector (15, -25) has a slope of -25/15 = -5/3, which is negative reciprocal? Wait, no. Slope is -5/3, which is just negative. The original slope is 5/3. So the direction vector's slope is negative but not reciprocal.\n\nWait, let me think. If the direction vector has slope m, then the line it defines has slope m. So in this case, direction vector has slope -5/3, but original line has slope 5/3. So they are not equal. Thus, direction vector is not correct. So option E's direction vector is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe it's a different direction vector but same line?\n\nWait, actually, in the context of lines, two direction vectors are considered the same line if they are scalar multiples of each other, but with the same or opposite directions.\n\nWait, but scalar multiples can have direction same or opposite.\n\nSo if I have a direction vector (15, -25), its slope is -5/3, which is the negative of the original slope.\n\nHmm, so they're not the same. So the line defined by the parameterization in option E has slope -5/3, which is different from 5/3, so that line is different from the original line.\n\nTherefore, even though the point is on the original line, the direction vector is incorrect, so option E is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on, let me cross-verify.\n\nWait, direction vector is (15, -25). So, starting from point (0, -17/3), if I move along direction vector (15, -25), is that on the same line? Let me plug in t=1:\n\nx = 0 +15=15, y = -17/3 -25 = -17/3 -75/3= (-92)/3 ≈ -30.666...\n\nBut if we plug x=15 into the original line: y = (5/3)*15 -17/3=75/3 -17/3=58/3 ≈19.333..., which is not equal to (-92)/3. Therefore, the point is not on the original line. Wait, no, the point when t=1 is on the parameterization, but not on the original line. So, so that would mean that the parameterization does not stay on the original line, which is a problem.\n\nWait, actually, even if t=0 is on the original line, but the direction vector is different, meaning that even with varying t, the parameterization may go off the line. So in this case, t=0: (0, -17/3) is on the line. t=1: (15, -17/3 -25) is not on the line, as we saw, so the parameterization actually describes a different line.\n\nSo, option E is invalid.\n\nWait a second, but perhaps the direction vector could be adjusted by scaling? Let's see, if direction vector is (15, -25), can that be scaled to get a direction vector with slope 5/3?\n\nSo if we take (15, -25) and multiply by (3), we get (45, -75), slope (-75)/45 = -5/3, which is still the same as before. Alternatively, if we take (-15,25), slope is 25/-15= -5/3. No, that's not the same as 5/3. So, it seems that by scaling, we can't get a direction vector with slope 5/3. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only options A and C are valid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check about option C's direction vector, just to make sure.\n\nDirection vector is (3/5, 1). So, to get slope: 1 divided by (3/5) is 5/3, which is correct. So if I move in steps of (3/5,1), that's consistent with slope 5/3, so yes, it's a valid direction vector.\n\nAnd since the starting point is on the line, the entire line is covered by the parameterization.\n\nSo, both A and C are valid. E is also point on the line but with a wrong direction vector, so it's invalid.\n\nWait, hold on, in option E, does the direction vector actually define a slope of 5/3? Let me compute:\n\n(Δy)/(Δx)= (-25)/15= -5/3. Hmm, negative reciprocal. If the original line has a slope of 5/3, the negative reciprocal is -3/5. So if direction vector slope is -5/3, which is different from -3/5, then they are not the same, and actually, it's not just a scaling. It's negative reciprocal, but not the same as the original slope.\n\nWait, no, direction vector slope is just slope, regardless of direction.\n\nWait, but slope is just a number, regardless of direction.\n\nWait, actually, maybe direction vectors only need to have the same slope, regardless of direction. So even if direction vector has negative slope, as long as magnitude is same as the given line's slope. Wait, no, actually, the direction vector must be scalar multiple of the given slope.\n\nWait, for a line y = mx + b, any direction vector must have slope m, so the direction vector (a, b) must satisfy b/a = m.\n\nTherefore, in option E, b/a = (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3, so the direction vector is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only A and C are valid.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Option A:** Point is on the line, direction vector slope matches. Valid.\n- **Option B:** Point is not on the line. Invalid.\n- **Option C:** Point is on the line, direction vector slope matches. Valid.\n- **Option D:** Point is on the line, but direction vector slope does not match. Invalid.\n- **Option E:** Point is on the line, but direction vector slope does not match.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these parameterizations are valid for the line given by y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Hmm, I remember that a parameterization of a line typically has two parts: a point on the line and a direction vector. The general form is something like r = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a specific point on the line, v is the direction vector, and t is a parameter. \n\nFirst, I should check if each option gives a point that lies on the line. So, for each parameterization, I can plug the point (when t=0) into the line equation and see if it satisfies y = (5/3)x - 17/3.\n\nThen, I need to check if the direction vector is correct. The direction vector should be parallel to the line, which for a line with slope m should have a direction vector like (3, 5) because the slope is 5/3. Or, any scalar multiple of that vector would also be valid since direction vectors can be scaled.\n\nSo, let me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nr = (4, 1) + t*(-3, -5)\n\nFirst, check if (4, 1) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=4 into the line equation:\ny = (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\nSo, yes, (4,1) is on the line. Good.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (-3, -5). The slope corresponding to this vector is (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which matches the given line. So, the direction is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\nr = (17, 5) + t*(6, 10)\n\nFirst, check if (17,5) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=17 into the equation: y = (5/3)*17 -17/3.\n\nCalculate that: 85/3 -17/3 = (85 -17)/3 = 68/3 ≈22.666...\n\nBut the y-value is 5, which is 15/3, so 15/3 ≠68/3. So, (17,5) is not on the line. Therefore, even if the direction vector was correct, since the point isn't on the line, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, let me check the direction vector just in case. The vector is (6,10). Slope is 10/6=5/3, which is correct. So, direction is correct, but the point isn't on the line, so it's not a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option C:**\nr = (2, -7/3) + t*(3/5, 1)\n\nCheck if (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=2 into the equation: y=(5/3)*2 -17/3 =10/3 -17/3 = -7/3. Yes, that's correct. So the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (3/5, 1). The slope here is 1/(3/5)=5/3, which matches the given line. So, the direction is correct.\n\nSo, Option C is valid.\n\n**Option D:**\nr = (14/5, -1) + t*(1, 3/5)\n\nFirst, check the point (14/5, -1).\n\nConvert 14/5 to decimal: 2.8.\n\nPlug x=14/5 into the equation: y = (5/3)*(14/5) -17/3.\n\nSimplify: (5/3)*(14/5)=14/3. So, y=14/3 -17/3= -3/3= -1. Perfect, that's correct. The point is on the line.\n\nNow, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). The slope is (3/5)/1=3/5, which is not equal to 5/3. So, the direction vector's slope is incorrect—it's the reciprocal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. The direction vector should have slope 5/3, but here it's 3/5. That means the direction vector is not parallel to the line, so this parameterization would trace a different line.\n\nHence, Option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\nr = (0, -17/3) + t*(15, -25)\n\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nPlug x=0 into the equation: y = (5/3)*0 -17/3= -17/3. Yes, it is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (15, -25). Slope is -25/15= -5/3, which is not equal to 5/3. So, the slope is negative reciprocal, meaning they are perpendicular, not parallel. So, this direction vector is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the direction vector is correct if we consider it as a parametric equation? Wait, no, the direction vector defines the slope of the line. Since the slope of the given line is positive, the direction vector should also have a positive slope. The given vector has a negative slope, so that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option E is invalid.\n\nSo, going back through the options:\n\nA: Valid\n\nB: Invalid\n\nC: Valid\n\nD: Invalid\n\nE: Invalid\n\nHence, the correct options are A and C.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options \\boxed{A} and \\boxed{C}.\n\nHowever, the instructions said to enter the letters separated by commas. So, it should be \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C} but within one box. Wait, no, I think it's just separate boxes, but the final answer is to be boxed and within \\boxed{}.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the user instructions say: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, just letters separated by commas, like \\boxed{A,C}\n\nBut since I was supposed to put the final answer within \\boxed{}, but maybe as individual boxed letters? Hmm, but in previous examples, they have multiple boxed answers. Maybe I should write \\boxed{A}, \\boxed{C} but that might not be standard. Alternatively, write \\boxed{AC} but that might be confusing.\n\nWait, actually, looking again at the instructions: \"Enter the letters of the correct options, separated by commas.\" So, if A and C are correct, it would be \"A,C\". So, to follow that, inside a single box: \\boxed{A,C}\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A,C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which parameterizations are valid for the line given by \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two things for each option: if the point (when \\( t = 0 \\)) lies on the line and if the direction vector is correct (i.e., its slope matches the given line's slope).\n\n1. **Option A**: \n   - Point: \\( (4, 1) \\)\n   - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(4) - \\frac{17}{3} = 1 \\).

Correct.\n   - Valid parameterization.\n\n2. **Option B**:\n   - Point: \\( (17, 5) \\)\n   - Check: \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}(17) - \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{68}{3} \\). Incorrect.\n   - Direction vector: \\( (6, 10) \\)\n   - Slope: \\( \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\).

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represent the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. There are five options labeled (A) through (E). Hmm, parameterizing a line with vectors involves expressing the line as a point plus a scalar multiple of a direction vector. \n\nFirst, I remember that any valid parameterization must satisfy two main conditions:\n\n1. The point given (the constant vector when t=0) must lie on the original line.\n2. The direction vector must be a scalar multiple of the line's slope direction. \n\nGiven the line equation y = (5/3)x - 17/3, I can note that the slope is 5/3, which is a direction vector of (3,5) because the direction vector (run, rise) should have a slope equal to the slope of the line. Alternatively, any scalar multiple of (3,5) is acceptable, like (6,10), (-3,-5), etc.\n\nSo, for each option, I'll check two things:\n\n- Is the starting point (when t=0) on the line?\n- Does the direction vector align with the slope (i.e., is it a scalar multiple of (3,5) or any of its scalar multiples, even negative ones)?\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nVector equation is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (4,1) lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Let's plug x=4 into the equation.\n\nCompute y: (5/3)*4 - 17/3 = (20/3) - (17/3) = 3/3 = 1. So, yes, (4,1) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector (-3,-5). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see. If we multiply (3,5) by -1, we get (-3,-5), which is exactly the direction vector here. So yes, this direction vector is valid. \n\nTherefore, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\nVector equation is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (17,5) lies on the line. Substitute x=17:\n\ny = (5/3)*17 - 17/3 = (85/3) - (17/3) = 68/3 ≈ 22.666..., but the given y is 5, which is 15/3 ≈5. So, 68/3 is not equal to 5, so the point is not on the line. \n\nSince the starting point doesn't lie on the original line, option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\nVector equation is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) lies on the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. Plug x=2 into the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*2 - 17/3 = (10/3) - (17/3) = (-7)/3. So, yes, (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector (3/5,1). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see. Let's assume there exists a scalar k such that (3/5,1) = k*(3,5). \n\nSo, 3/5 = 3k => k = (3/5)/3 = 1/5.\n\nThen check the second component: 1 = 5k => 1 = 5*(1/5) = 1. So yes, that works. Therefore, the direction vector is valid.\n\nHence, option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:**\nVector equation is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) lies on the line. Compute y when x=14/5.\n\nCompute y = (5/3)*(14/5) - 17/3 = (14/3) - (17/3) = (-3)/3 = -1. So, yes, (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector (1, 3/5). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see.\n\nLet’s assume (1, 3/5) = k*(3,5). Then,\n\n1 = 3k => k=1/3\n\nThen check the second component: 3/5 = 5k => 3/5 = 5*(1/3) = 5/3 ≈1.666..., which is not equal to 3/5 = 0.6. Therefore, the direction vector is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). So, is there any other way?\n\nAlternatively, let me check if (1, 3/5) is a scalar multiple of (5/3,1), which is the slope vector in standard form. Wait, actually, the direction vector should be (run, rise) such that rise/run = slope.\n\nGiven slope 5/3, so rise = 5, run = 3, direction vector is (3,5). If we have direction vector (1, 3/5), that's because run =1, rise = 3/5, which is exactly 5/3. Because (3/5)/1 = 3/5 = 5/3 inverted? Wait, wait. \n\nWait, slope is rise over run, so direction vector is (run, rise). So (1, 3/5) would have slope (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But the given line has a slope of 5/3, so 3/5 ≠ 5/3. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\nHence, the direction vector is not aligned with the slope of the original line. So, even though the starting point is on the line, the direction vector is incorrect. Therefore, option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\nVector equation is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) lies on the line. Since x=0, substitute into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3. So, yes, (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nNext, check the direction vector (15, -25). Is this a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see.\n\nLet’s denote k such that 15 = 3k => k=5.\n\nThen check the second component: -25 =5k => k = -5. \n\nHmm, so 3k would give 15 for k=5, but 5k would give 25 for k=5. However, here, we have k =5 for x-component, but for y-component, we have -25 =5k would imply k=-5. So, inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, can we write (15, -25) as a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's check the ratio of the components.\n\n15/3 =5, and -25/5 = -5. Since these are not equal, it's not a scalar multiple. But wait, that can't be. Wait, if 15=3k and -25=5k, then k must be both 5 and -5, which is impossible. Therefore, (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a scalar multiple of (5, -25/3), which might be another way to represent the slope. But no, because in parametric equations, direction vectors can be scaled, but to have the same slope. So, unless direction vector is a scalar multiple of (3,5), the slope would change.\n\nWait, but hold on, since the direction vector is (15, -25). The slope would be (-25)/15 = -5/3, which is the negative reciprocal of 5/3. Hmm, wait, 5/3 * (-5/3) = -25/9, which isn't -1. That means they are not negative reciprocals, so these two lines would not be perpendicular.\n\nBut actually, the slope of our original line is 5/3. The direction vector of E is (15, -25). The slope of this direction vector is -25/15 = -5/3, which is not 5/3, but the negative reciprocal would be -3/5, which is different.\n\nWait, maybe I confused direction vector with something else.\n\nBut in this case, since the direction vector is (15, -25), that would actually point downward, which isn't the direction of the original line, which has a positive slope. Moreover, the direction vector's slope is negative, which is different from our original line.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about parametric equations, the direction vector (15, -25) would imply that as t increases, x increases by 15 and y decreases by 25, which is opposite to the line's slope. So, this direction vector points in the opposite direction to the line, but the point is on the line, so is this a problem?\n\nWait, actually, in parameterizations, as long as the direction vector is parallel to the line, it can point in either direction. So, is (15, -25) a scalar multiple of (3,5) or (5,3)?\n\nWait, let me see. Let's suppose that (15, -25) = k*(5, -3). Because if the direction vector is (5, -3), that's consistent with slope (-3)/5 = -3/5, which is different from our original slope of 5/3. Hmm, so no. Alternatively, (15, -25) can be written as 5*(3, -5). So, 5*(3, -5), which is (15, -25). But (3, -5) would have slope (-5)/3, which is again different from our original slope.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me calculate the slope of the direction vector (15, -25). It's rise over run: -25/15 = -5/3. The slope of the line is 5/3. These are negative reciprocals? Wait, 5/3 and -3/5 are negative reciprocals because their product is -1. \n\nBut here, we have slope of direction vector as -5/3, and the original line's slope is 5/3. So they are negatives of each other, but not negative reciprocals.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector of E is not parallel to the original line, since it has a different slope. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nWait, but another thought: Perhaps I can see if the direction vector can be scaled to match (3,5). But direction vector is (15, -25). If we take (3,5) and multiply by 5, we get (15,25). But here it's (15, -25). So, (15,-25) is (15,25) multiplied by -1 in the y-component. So that would flip the direction but not maintain the same slope.\n\nIn other words, if the direction vector were (15,25), that would be (5,5/3) which is (5, approximately 1.666), so slope is 1.666, but 5/3 is approximately 1.666, so that would be correct. But since it's (15,-25), which is (15, -25), that's a different slope.\n\nHence, the direction vector is not parallel to the original line, so option E is invalid.\n\nWait, but in case I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check option E. Starting point is (0, -17/3), which is on the line. Then, if we use t=1, for example, we get (15, -25 -17/3) = (15, -(25 + 17/3)) = (15, -(75/3 +17/3))= (15, -92/3). \n\nWait, let's see if (15, -92/3) lies on the original line. Compute y when x=15: (5/3)*15 -17/3 = 25 -17/3 = (75/3 -17/3)=58/3 ≈19.333. However, when x=15, y would be 58/3, which is positive, whereas in this case, we get y=-92/3, which is much lower. So, the direction is incorrect.\n\nSo, the point is on the line but the direction vector is incorrect, meaning the parameterization is incorrect.\n\nSo, in conclusion, only options A and C are valid parameterizations because they have starting points on the line and direction vectors aligned with the slope. The others either have the starting point wrong or a direction vector that doesn't match the slope.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe valid parameterizations are options A and C, so the answer is \\boxed{A,C}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which of the given parameterizations correctly represent the line \\( y = \\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{17}{3} \\), we need to check two main conditions for each option:\n\n1.

                "full_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given parameterizations correctly represents the line y = (5/3)x - 17/3. There are five options, labeled A to E. I need to determine which of these are valid.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a parameterization of a line can be written in the form r = r0 + t*v, where r0 is a point on the line, and v is a direction vector of the line. So, to check if a parameterization is valid, I need to ensure two things: \n\n1. The point r0 lies on the given line.\n2. The direction vector v is parallel to the given line's direction, which is determined by its slope.\n\nThe original line is y = (5/3)x - 17/3. The slope here is 5/3. So, any direction vector for this line must have a slope equal to 5/3. The direction vector can be any scalar multiple of (3,5), because the slope is 5/3, which can be represented as the vector (3,5) or any multiple of it.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to do two things:\n\n1. Plug in the point r0 into the equation of the line to check if it lies on the line.\n2. Check if the direction vector v has a slope of 5/3 or is a scalar multiple.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nParameterization:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if (4,1) lies on the line. Plug x=4 into the line equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(4) - 17/3 = 20/3 - 17/3 = 3/3 = 1.\n\nSo, y=1 when x=4, which is exactly the point given. That's good.\n\nNext, check the direction vector: (-3, -5). What's the slope? It's (-5)/(-3) = 5/3, which matches the slope of the given line. So, the direction is correct.\n\nTherefore, option A is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option B:**\nParameterization:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 17 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if (17,5) lies on the line:\n\ny = (5/3)(17) -17/3.\n\nCalculate 5/3 *17 = 85/3. Subtract 17/3: 85/3 -17/3 = 68/3 ≈ 22.666. So, the y should be 22.666, but according to the parameterization, y is 5. That's not equal, so the point is not on the line. Therefore, option B is invalid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me also check the direction vector.\n\nDirection vector is (6,10). The slope is 10/6 = 5/3, which is correct. But since the point doesn't lie on the line, it's not a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option C:**\nParameterization:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if (2, -7/3) lies on the line:\n\ny = (5/3)(2) -17/3 = 10/3 -17/3 = (-7)/3 ≈ -2.333, which is equal to -7/3. So, yes, the point is on the line.\n\nNow, check the direction vector: (3/5,1). Let's compute the slope: 1 / (3/5) = 5/3. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think—if the direction vector is (3/5,1), is that a scalar multiple of (3,5)? Let's see:\n\nIf we multiply (3,5) by 1/5, we get (3/5,1). So yes, it's just a scaled version.\n\nSo, direction is correct, point is on the line, so option C is a valid parameterization.\n\n**Option D:**\nParameterization:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 14/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if (14/5, -1) is on the line.\n\nCalculate y from the equation:\n\ny = (5/3)(14/5) -17/3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5/3)(14/5) = 14/3. Then, subtract 17/3: 14/3 -17/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. That's exactly the given y-coordinate. So, point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is (1, 3/5). Compute the slope: (3/5)/1 = 3/5. But our original line has slope 5/3. 3/5 ≠ 5/3. So, the direction vector is not correct.\n\nSo, the direction is wrong, even though the point is correct. Therefore, option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but sometimes direction vectors can be in the opposite direction, so negative slope. But since 3/5 is different from 5/3, just reciprocal? Wait, no.\n\nWait, 3/5 is less than 1, while 5/3 is more than 1. The slopes are not reciprocal or anything. So, no, they are different.\n\nSo, direction is incorrect. So, option D is invalid.\n\n**Option E:**\nParameterization:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -17/3 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ -25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, check if (0, -17/3) is on the line.\n\nCompute y = (5/3)*0 -17/3 = -17/3. So, y=-17/3 when x=0, which is exactly the point. So, point is on the line.\n\nNow, direction vector is (15, -25). Let's compute the slope: (-25)/15 = -5/3.\n\nBut the slope of the original line is 5/3, so here the slope is -5/3. That's negative of the original slope. So, the direction vector is going in the opposite direction. But lines are infinitely long in both directions, so does that matter?\n\nWait, direction vectors can point in either direction as long as they are scalar multiples. So, since (-25,15) would have a slope of (-25)/15 = -5/3, but if I reverse the vector, it's (25, -15), which has a slope of -5/3. Hmm, but wait, actually, scaling direction vector can give same line.\n\nWait, the line is defined for all real numbers t, so adding a multiple can change the direction. So, is direction vector (15,-25) a scalar multiple of (3,5)?\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose 15 = k*3, which implies k=5, then check if -25 =k*5. So, -25=5*5=25. Wait, -25≠25. So, no. Thus, direction vector (15, -25) is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). Hmm, but is it a scalar multiple of (-3,-5)? Let me check:\n\nIf I use direction vector (15,-25) and see if it's a multiple of (-3,-5). So, let's see if 15 = k*(-3), which implies k = -5, then check y-component: -25 = (-5)*(-5)=25. But -25≠25. So, that's not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, is (15, -25) a scalar multiple of (5, -7)? Wait, no, original direction vector is based on slope 5/3. So, perhaps better to calculate if direction vector's slope matches.\n\nEarlier, we saw the slope is -5/3, which is different from 5/3. So, the line defined by the parameterization will have the same points, but moving in a different direction.\n\nSo, actually, direction is not 5/3, it's -5/3. So, even though the point is on the line, the direction vector is in the opposite direction, so it won't be a valid parameterization.\n\nTherefore, option E is invalid.\n\nWait, but the parameter t can take any real number, so t can be positive or negative, so maybe it's still okay? Wait, actually, for a line, direction vectors can point in either direction, so even if the direction vector is in the opposite direction, as long as the point is correct, it's still a valid parameterization.\n\nWait, but in that case, would (15,-25) represent the direction?\n\nWait, let's recompute. The direction vector is (15,-25). The line should have a direction vector proportional to (3,5). If (15,-25) is proportional, then (15,-25)=k*(3,5). So, 15=3k, so k=5, but then -25=5k=25, which is not true. So, it's not a scalar multiple. So, direction is different.\n\nSo, in that case, it's not valid.\n\nWait, perhaps, but is (15,-25) a scalar multiple of (3,5)?\n\nCompute:\n\nLet me check:\n\n15 = 3*k,\n\nso k = 5.\n\nBut then, 5*5=25≠-25.\n\nThus, it is not. So, the direction is different.\n\nSo, the slope is different. Thus, direction vector is incorrect. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nWait, but if I write the direction vector as (15,-25), then the line equation in parametric form would be x=0+15t, y= -17/3 -25t.\n\nLet's check if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nCompute y=(5/3)x -17/3.\n\nSubstitute x=15t, y= -17/3 -25t.\n\nSo, y=(5/3)(15t) -17/3 = 75t/3 -17/3 = 25t -17/3.\n\nBut our y is -17/3 -25t.\n\nComparing:\n\n(5/3)x -17/3 =25t -17/3,\n\nbut y is = -17/3 -25t.\n\nSo, 25t -17/3 ≠ -17/3 -25t.\n\nUnless 25t= -25t, which implies t=0.\n\nSo, the two lines only intersect at t=0, but are different otherwise.\n\nTherefore, this parameterization does not represent the original line. Therefore, option E is invalid.\n\nTherefore, going back, of the five options:\n\nA: valid\n\nB: invalid (point not on line)\n\nC: valid\n\nD: invalid (slope wrong)\n\nE: invalid\n\nSo, the valid parameterizations are A and C.\n\nWait, just double-checking.\n\nWait, for option C, direction vector (3/5,1). So, slope is 1/(3/5)=5/3, which matches.\n\nAnd the point (2, -7/3) is on the line.\n\nSo, yeah, C is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for A, the direction vector (-3,-5), slope 5/3, and the point (4,1) is on the line.\n\nYes, both A and C are correct.\n\nWait, let me just check one more time in case I messed up with the direction.\n\nIn option D, direction vector is (1,3/5). Slope is (3/5)/1=3/5, which is inverse of 5/3. So, it's the negative reciprocal? No, inverse. Wait, no, 3/5 is less than 1, but in the original line, the slope is 5/3.\n\nSo, the direction vectors for the same line must have a slope equal to 5/3. So, any vector where y/x=5/3 is okay.\n\nFor example, (3,5), (6,10), (-3,-5), etc. So, if direction vector has slope 5/3, it's fine.\n\nSo, in option D, the direction vector is (1, 3/5). So, slope is 3/5. Which is 3/5, not 5/3.\n\nSo, if I want a direction vector for slope 5/3, for example, if I have x-component as 5, y-component should be 3.\n\nAlternatively, if x is 3, y is 5.\n\nBut in D, direction vector is (1, 3/5). So, slope is 3/5. So, which is not 5/3.\n\nTherefore, no.\n\nWait, but 3/5 is 0.6 and 5/3 is approximately 1.666. So, those are different.\n\nHence, direction is different, so not correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, D is invalid.\n\nE, as we saw, the slope is negative 5/3, but with the point on the line, so maybe this is a question of direction, whether you can go in negative direction or not.\n\nBut for a line, in parameterization, since t can be any real number, positive or negative, both directions are acceptable. But does the direction vector actually influence the slope?\n\nWait, the direction vector should be such that it's along the line, regardless of direction.\n\nBut for a line, if a parameterization is given, it must pass through the given point and have direction vector parallel to the line. So, direction vector can be any scalar multiple, positive or negative.\n\nSo, in E, the direction vector is (15,-25), which is not a scalar multiple of (3,5). But it is a scalar multiple of (-3, -5), because 15= -5*(-3), -25= -5*(-5). So, it's scaling the (-3,-5) vector by -5. So, that's a scalar multiple.\n\nWait, because (15,-25) is equal to (-5)*( -3, 5). Wait, no:\n\nWait, 15= k*(-3), which implies k= -5. Similarly, -25= k*(5). Wait, no: direction vector is (3,5), as in (3,5). But in the parameterization, the direction vector is (15,-25). So, 15= k*3, which k=5, but then y-component should be 5*k=25, but here y-component is -25, which would be -25= k*5=5*5=25. So, no, that is not a scalar multiple.\n\nBut if we take the direction vector as (15,-25), is that a scalar multiple of (-3,-5)?\n\n15 = k*(-3), so k= -5.\n\nThen check y-component: -25 =k*(-5)= -5*(-5)=25. But -25≠25, so that's not. So, it's not a scalar multiple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (15,-25) is a scalar multiple of (3, -5). Let's check:\n\n15 = k*3 => k=5,\n\nThen, -25= k*(-5)=5*(-5)=-25. So, yes! So, (15,-25)=5*(3,-5). Therefore, (15,-25) is a scalar multiple of (3,-5), which has slope (-5)/3= -5/3.\n\nBut original slope is 5/3, so it's in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, so even though it's a scalar multiple, it's a different direction. So, does that mean that the line isn't being correctly represented?\n\nWait, in the original line, direction vectors are either (3,5) or (-3,-5). But here, the direction vector is (3,-5), which is a different direction (points in the opposite direction to y-axis). So, even though it's a scalar multiple, but the line is defined as such that it's moving in the opposite direction.\n\nBut in parametric equations, it's the same line, because the parameter t can take any real value, so even if the direction is reversed, the line is the same.\n\nBut in this case, the slope in parametric form is -5/3 instead of 5/3, so the parametrization is going in the opposite direction.\n\nBut the original line's equation is y = (5/3)x -17/3, which is a specific line. So, is a parametrization with slope -5/3 still correct?\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the slope of the line is determined by the relationship between x and y in the line equation. If you have a parameterization that goes in the opposite direction, the slope in the Cartesian equation will have the negative sign.\n\nWait, in other words, if I have a parameterization with direction vector (a,b), the slope is b/a, but the original line's slope is 5/3, so unless direction vector's slope is 5/3, it's incorrect. So, even though (15,-25) is a scalar multiple of (3,-5), which has slope -5/3, which is different from the original line's slope, 5/3.\n\nTherefore, the line defined by E's parameterization is y = (-5/3)x + c, for some c. So, it's a different line, with slope -5/3, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, even though the point (0,-17/3",
