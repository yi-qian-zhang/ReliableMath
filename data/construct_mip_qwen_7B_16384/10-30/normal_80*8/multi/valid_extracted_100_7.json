The given polar equation is \\( \\rho = \\frac{2}{1 - \\cos\\theta} \\). Using the relationships \\( x = \\rho \\cos\\theta \\) and \\( y = \\rho \\sin\\theta \\), we can rewrite the equation in Cartesian coordinates as \\( (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). This is the equation of a circle centered at \\( (1, 0) \\) with radius 1.\n\nNext, we find the minimum distance between a point on curve \\( C_{1} \\), which is a straight line, and a point on curve \\( C_{2} \\), the circle. The parametric equations of \\( C_{1} \\) are \\( x = 2t - 1 \\) and \\( y = -4t - 2 \\). The Cartesian equation of \\( C_{1} \\) can be derived by eliminating the parameter \\( t \\), resulting in \\( y = -2x \\).\n\nTo find the minimum distance between the two curves, we can find the shortest distance from the line \\( y = -2x \\) to the circle \\( (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. The center of the circle is \\( (1, 0) \\). The distance from this point to the line \\( y = -2x \\) is calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line, which is \\( \\frac{|2(1) + 0|}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\). Since the radius of the circle is 1, the minimum distance between the two curves is \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} - 1 \\).\n\nHowever, simplifying this, we get the minimum distance as \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\).",
