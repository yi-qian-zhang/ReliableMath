Perhaps on the beach (one chance in two) or on the tennis court (one chance in four), it could be that she is in the cafe (also one chance in four). If Béatrice is on the beach, which is large and crowded, François has a one in two chance of not finding her.

The store plans to implement a prize sales promotion for the selected products, which involves increasing the price by $150$ yuan on top of the current price.
