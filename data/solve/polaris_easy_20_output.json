    "gpt4o_answer": "To investigate the stability of the equilibrium point \\((x, y) = (0, 0)\\) for the given system, we will use the method of linearization and analyze the nature of the equilibrium point.\n\nThe system of differential equations is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = y^3 + x^5, \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = x^3 + y^5.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we find the Jacobian matrix of the system at the equilibrium point \\((0, 0)\\).

In such cases, we need to consider higher-order terms or use other methods to determine stability.\n\nSince the system is nonlinear and the linearization is inconclusive, we can use the method of Lyapunov functions to analyze stability. Consider the Lyapunov function:\n\n\\[\nV(x, y) = x^2 + y^2.\n\\]\n\nThis function is positive definite in a neighborhood of the origin. Now, compute the time derivative of \\(V\\) along the trajectories of the system:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} \\frac{dy}{dt}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n\n- \\(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 2x\\),\n- \\(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 2y\\).\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = 2x(y^3 + x^5) + 2y(x^3 + y^5).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = 2xy^3 + 2x^6 + 2yx^3 + 2y^6.\n\\]\n\nNotice that each term in \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) is non-negative, and the lowest order terms are \\(2xy^3\\) and \\(2yx^3\\), both of which are of order 4. Therefore, \\(\\frac{dV}{dt} \\geq 0\\) in a neighborhood of the origin, indicating that the origin is a stable equilibrium point.\n\nHowever, since \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) is not strictly negative, we cannot conclude asymptotic stability. Therefore, the equilibrium point \\((0, 0)\\) is stable but not asymptotically stable.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Stable, but not asymptotically stable}}\n\\]",

In this case, the triangle is isosceles right-angled, and \\( c = \\sqrt{2}a \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( a = b \\) into the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3a^2 + a^2} + \\sqrt{3a^2 + a^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{4a^2}}{\\sqrt{2a^2}} = \\frac{4a}{\\sqrt{2}a} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}\\).",

    "gpt4o_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine when \\( S(n) = \\tau(1) + \\tau(2) + \\cdots + \\tau(n) \\) is odd or even. \n\nFirst, observe that \\(\\tau(n)\\), the number of divisors of \\(n\\), is odd if and only if \\(n\\) is a perfect square. This is because divisors usually come in pairs, except when \\(n\\) is a perfect square, where the square root is counted only once.\n\nNext, consider the parity of \\(S(n)\\). We have:\n\n\\[\nS(n) = \\tau(1) + \\tau(2) + \\cdots + \\tau(n).\n\\]\n\nThe parity of \\(S(n)\\) depends on the number of odd terms in the sequence \\(\\tau(1), \\tau(2), \\ldots, \\tau(n)\\). Since \\(\\tau(k)\\) is odd if and only if \\(k\\) is a perfect square, the parity of \\(S(n)\\) is determined by the number of perfect squares up to \\(n\\).\n\nLet \\(m\\) be the largest integer such that \\(m^2 \\leq n\\). Then there are \\(m\\) perfect squares up to \\(n\\), namely \\(1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, m^2\\).\n\nThus, \\(S(n)\\) is odd if and only if \\(m\\) is odd, and \\(S(n)\\) is even if and only if \\(m\\) is even.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of integers \\(n \\leq 2005\\) for which \\(S(n)\\) is odd and even.\n\n1.

The number of perfect squares up to 2005 is 44. Therefore, \\(m = 44\\).\n\n3. Since \\(m = 44\\) is even, \\(S(2005)\\) is even.\n\n4. For \\(n \\leq 2005\\), \\(S(n)\\) is odd when the number of perfect squares up to \\(n\\) is odd, i.e., when \\(m\\) is odd. This occurs for \\(m = 1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 43\\).\n\n5.
